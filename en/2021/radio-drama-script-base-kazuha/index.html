<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In a time of extreme instability across the globe, the General suddenly issued a Sword Hunt Decree, ordering the confiscation of swords carried by civilians, which incited discontent among various samurai factions and civilian organizations, leading them to unite and form a resistance army. Despite being intended to stabilize society, this decision only exacerbated social unrest. Amidst the chaos, Wanye&rsquo;s friend bravely ventured forth alone to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at the Imperial Court, witnessing only his friend&rsquo;s fallen figure. Forced to flee with his friend&rsquo;s sword, Wanye inherited his friend&rsquo;s legacy and was rescued by pirates during his pursuit, ultimately fostering collaboration between the pirates and the resistance army. Raising the banner of rebellion, Wanye finally stood before the General, using his sense of righteousness to illustrate the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.</p>
<h3 id="character-settings">Character Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wanye</strong>: A wandering samurai hailing from a once-proud but now destitute samurai family. Courteous in demeanor, gentle yet romantic, he enjoys composing poetry and displays the carefree spirit of a rōnin while nurturing a deep compassion for the suffering of all living beings. He remains calm and contented, cherishing nature and possessing acute hearing and exceptional martial prowess, especially fond of maple leaves. His voice quality is youthful, primarily resonating in the larynx with a hint of chest resonance; his pronunciation originates near the hard palate.</li>
<li><strong>Friend</strong>: A wandering samurai characterized by his open and bold personality, determined and valiant, with a heart set on sacrificing himself to save others. Skilled in martial arts, he believes himself to be the one capable of standing before the General to remonstrate, choosing to do so single-handedly, ultimately falling in combat within the Imperial Court but leaving a lasting impact through his courage and sense of righteousness.</li>
<li><strong>The General</strong>: The ruler, revered by the populace as a War God, having undergone significant personal changes following multiple wars where her loved ones perished, gradually becoming detached from the people. She pursued the concept of &ldquo;eternal immutability&rdquo; and enacted the Sword Hunt Decree to maintain national stability. Eventually, she comes to realize the decree&rsquo;s irrationality under the influence of Wanye and his friend.</li>
<li><strong>Big Sister</strong>: The leader of the pirate gang, known for her bold and straightforward demeanor. She particularly appreciates Wanye&rsquo;s poetic talents.</li>
<li><strong>Strategist</strong>: The leader of the resistance army advocating for the right of civilians to carry swords, believing that the collective power of the people could sway the General&rsquo;s stance.</li>

<p>During a period of intense global instability, the General unexpectedly instigated a Sword Hunt Decree, aiming to collect privately-owned swords, causing dissatisfaction among various samurais and civilian groups, who consequently coalesced into a resistance force. The policy, initially designed to stabilize the nation, instead triggered massive societal upheaval. In the tumultuous times, Wanye&rsquo;s friend ventured solo to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at court, seeing only his friend&rsquo;s fallen silhouette. Taking his friend&rsquo;s sword and fleeing, Wanye, inheriting his friend&rsquo;s aspirations, united with pirates during his escape, leading to cooperation between pirates and the resistance army. Ultimately, he faced the General with a compassionate heart, demonstrating the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.</p>

<h3 id="act-i-the-sleeve-fluttering-in-autumn-wind-asking-for-red-leaves">Act I: The Sleeve Fluttering in Autumn Wind Asking for Red Leaves</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, Acquaintance</p>
<p>Setting: A forest clearing in the wilderness</p>
<p>[Environmental Sounds] {Wan Ye kneels down to play a leaf whistle, finishing with reciting poetry}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Traversing the deep mountains amidst red leaves, my ears ask after deer’s song. [Brief rustling wind sound]</p>
<p>{Wan Ye sits up, flutters his sleeves, accompanied by the sound of fabric swaying and unsheathing a blade}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Who approaches?</p>
<p>{The Acquaintance enters from behind Wan Ye}</p>
<p>Acquaintance: No need to be so tense, little brother. (pauses for 1 second) Your clothes may seem tattered at first glance, but the design is incredibly intricate. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the maple leaf pattern on your attire is your family crest, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: So what if it is? Are you here to rob me, or to duel?</p>
<p>Acquaintance: Haha, maybe just to compare swords. {Both draw their blades and charge towards each other}</p>
<p>[Sounds of footsteps][Clashing of blades]</p>
<p>Wan Ye and Acquaintance: (grunting and exerting effort during the sword exchange)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Huh {Wan Ye parries the blade}[Their swords lock momentarily]</p>
<p>Acquaintance: Good swordsmanship! (laughs) How did you manage to spot me just now?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I can hear the wind&rsquo;s voice, and it grew unusually restless just now, suggesting you&rsquo;re someone who can&rsquo;t keep still. Yet, I also detect no malice in you.</p>
<p>Acquaintance: Haha, even though you sensed no ill intent, your strike was quite fierce.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: When comparing swords, one naturally gives it their all; otherwise, how could we justify the stirring of the wind. But I believe that chance encounters have their own significance. My name is Wan Ye, and yours?</p>
<p>{Sound fades out as the memory ends}</p>
<p>[End of Flashback]</p>
<h3 id="act-ii-the-oceanic-gale-that-hurts-maple-leaves">Act II: The Oceanic Gale That Hurts Maple Leaves</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Acquaintance</p>
<p>Setting: Onboard a ship</p>
<p>[Gradually intensifying sea breeze] {Wan Ye wakes up from a dream, feeling a bit of a headache}</p>
<p>(Allow breathing sounds for 2 seconds)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Ah (sighs)</p>
<p>{Sister Leader walks up to engage in conversation, footsteps on wooden deck}</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Wan Ye, we&rsquo;re about to set sail soon. What are you daydreaming about here?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Just reminiscing about some past events.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Speaking of past events, I really did bring this unknown and potentially dangerous element onto the ship.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (chuckles lightly) Sister Leader, you jest. There wasn&rsquo;t time before to explain. (pauses for 1 second) My past&hellip; the most memorable part was when I lived as a wandering samurai, drifting without roots, no fixed abode, yet there were benefits. Staying too long in one place would create a distance between me and nature. Perhaps wandering is indeed the lifestyle most suited for me.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Wandering and drifting, it&rsquo;s a bit like our life on this ship, sailing with the waves, never anchoring for long at any port.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: But my life might be more akin to a maple leaf dancing in the wind, unattached to anything, free from burdens and attachments, acquainting myself with all things under heaven and earth, inhaling the essence of the four directions—this is the state I enjoy.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Why the maple leaf?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I&rsquo;ve always had an affinity for maple leaves, though they often symbolize partings during their crimson season.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: But the red leaves are like fire, passionate and radiant.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Yes, indeed they are.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: I have another question—how did a wanderer like you end up being wanted by your lord?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: {Wan Ye lifts his sword} That story begins with the owner of this very sword.</p>
<h3 id="act-iii-reminiscence">Act III: Reminiscence</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, Passerby</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s soliloquy: He used to be my closest friend. That day he asked me about&hellip; {soliloquy fades out}</p>
<p>[Natural sounds, bird calls, etc.] {Wan Ye practices swordplay with his friend, both panting slightly afterwards}</p>
<p>Friend: Wan Ye, have you ever heard of the &lsquo;Thoughtless Blade&rsquo;?[Cat meows] {Wan Ye pets the cat}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Of course, such a blade is only seen during divine retribution. It represents the pinnacle of the general&rsquo;s martial arts prowess, symbolizing ultimate strength.</p>
<p>Friend: However, that blade may not be entirely unattainable. There are living beings on earth who dare to face the might of thunderbolts.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Nonetheless, currently, my swordsmanship cannot compare to that of the general.</p>
<p>Friend: Haha, aiming for it is still a worthy goal nonetheless.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (light chuckle) Mm.</p>
<p>Friend: I will dedicate my life to pursuing the utmost limit of martial arts, to confront that &lsquo;Thoughtless Blade&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: But I&rsquo;ve always wondered, why do we travel far and wide, honing our swordsmanship? What does a samurai&rsquo;s sword truly mean? Before my wandering days, I couldn&rsquo;t find the meaning of swordsmanship within the remnants of my family&rsquo;s teachings.</p>
<p>Friend: Wan Ye, if someday our land is eroded by calamity, and its people are no longer under the watchful eye of the gods, what choice would you make?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I suppose I&rsquo;d choose to live a life of anonymity.</p>
<p>Friend: Humph, you wouldn&rsquo;t. {pats Wan Ye&rsquo;s shoulder}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Huh? [Cat meows]</p>
<p>{Friend departs}</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s soliloquy: Later, unexpectedly, the Sword Hunt Decree came into effect, and the people&rsquo;s wishes gradually became bricks and mortar for constructing &ldquo;eternity&rdquo;. {soliloquy fades out}</p>
<p>[Light rain] {Wan Ye walks down the street}</p>
<p>Passerby A: (whispering) Have you heard about the Sword Hunt Decree&hellip;</p>
<p>Passerby B: Yeah, these days soldiers patrol the streets frequently, and occasionally you can hear the distant sound of swords clashing.</p>
<p>Passerby A: It&rsquo;s said that some samurais have formed a resistance army, demanding the repeal of the Sword Hunt Decree.</p>
<p>Passerby B: Actually, issuing the Sword Hunt Decree at this time&hellip; {voice trails off}</p>
<p>Samurai A: (whispering) What should we do in this situation?</p>
<p>Samurai B: Maybe we should just surrender our swords obediently.</p>
<p>Samurai A: (barely containing anger) How could we? The sword is&hellip; {voice fades out}</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s inner thoughts: Fleeing reluctantly, amidst flashing blades and tumultuous journeys, the land now sees samurai&rsquo;s aspirations ruthlessly stripped away. Enduring warfare perplexes me, whether it&rsquo;s due to samurai&rsquo;s obstinacy or sudden policy shifts.</p>
<p>{While Wan Ye contemplates, Passersby C and D discuss the Friend}</p>
<p>Passerby C: There are unusually few patrolling soldiers today.</p>
<p>Passerby D: Word has it that a wandering samurai challenged the general in a royal court duel today, which is why most soldiers are maintaining order. {Wan Ye stops, exhales heavily}</p>
<p>Passerby C: This samurai is indeed brave. Challenging the general in a royal court duel is the sole means to demand change from those pursuing eternity, but failure means certain death.</p>
<p>Passerby D: To defy the dignity of the &lsquo;God of War&rsquo; takes real courage.</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s inner thoughts: Could it be him&hellip;</p>
<p>{Wan Ye turns and sprints towards the royal palace} [Rain and footsteps fade out]</p>
<p>[Rain and thunder sounds]</p>
<p>{Wan Ye runs up the steps, panting}</p>
<p>[At the moment Wan Ye reaches the royal court, lightning strikes, and the Friend falls]</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (inhales sharply in shock)</p>
<p>{Wan Ye rushes forward to embrace the fallen Friend} [Hugging sound followed by the sound of the sword falling]</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (clenching teeth) {Wan Ye picks up his Friend&rsquo;s sword and escapes, ending with the sound of getting up}</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s soliloquy: The royal court duel is solemn and brutal; the loser faces divine punishment while the winner earns a turning point. Perhaps he thought himself the best candidate to stand up. Confronting the &lsquo;Thoughtless Blade&rsquo; was his lifelong pursuit. When I arrived, the duel had ended, and all I heard was the sound of his sword hitting the ground after &lsquo;divine retribution&rsquo;. That must have been the radiance he sought to witness. In his final moments, what expression graced his face? There was no time to ponder; I seized his sword and fled. All I knew was that I couldn&rsquo;t let his fervent wish be cast into a cold statue. {soliloquy ends}</p>
<h3 id="after-the-third-act-reminiscence">After the Third Act: Reminiscence</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader</p>
<p>Setting: Onboard the ship</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Your friend is truly admirable. Despite having different beliefs and ideals, you two conversed harmoniously, making it indeed a fateful encounter as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Although I&rsquo;ve never fully understood what samurais stubbornly pursue, upon picking up my friend&rsquo;s sword, I finally comprehended his aspirations and convictions, and realized the significance of starting a journey with the sword for a samurai.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: You think this conviction must be witnessed by the general herself, hence why you convinced me to accept the resistance army&rsquo;s employment.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Sister Leader, you&rsquo;re perceptive indeed. Even though you know of my personal motive, you won&rsquo;t refuse this employment anymore.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Such a fiery desire – I&rsquo;m also curious whether it can shake the &rsquo;eternity&rsquo; upheld by the general.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Many times, I questioned myself if my discontent with the general stemmed from that royal court duel or her decisive strike against my friend. But I realize it&rsquo;s not that; I simply want righteousness to be met with righteousness. Is the &lsquo;Thoughtless Blade&rsquo; truly unattainable? Perhaps one day, we&rsquo;ll be able to confront that kind of overwhelming power, which is precisely why I want to return.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-of-the-previous-episode">Conclusion of the Previous Episode</h3>
<p>Characters: The General</p>
<p>Setting: Silent Royal Palace</p>
<p>General: Amidst this fleeting world, not only dreams can manifest in slumber; everything is ephemeral. The world is like a dream, and only &rsquo;eternity&rsquo; can protect all sentient beings. Desires are perhaps the most unstable factor. But, much like then, he charged forth fearlessly, much like you, sister.</p>

<h3 id="next-episode-opening">Next Episode Opening</h3>
<p>Characters: The General, Attendant</p>
<p>Setting: Silent Imperial Residence</p>
<p>General: What is the current battle situation?</p>
<p>Attendant: We&rsquo;re still at a standoff; there hasn&rsquo;t been an opportunity to wipe out the Resistance Army in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>General: (pondering) Hmm. Ordinarily isolated samurais have managed to form an alliance, despite differing philosophies. How have these diverse individuals come together and achieved a unity that rivals the military&rsquo;s might? Such power cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Attendant: What orders do you have, General?</p>
<p>General: I will set out tomorrow to quell the Resistance Army. You may withdraw for now.</p>
<p>Attendant: Understood. {Attendant retreats}</p>
<p>General&rsquo;s Soliloquy: Changes brought about by samurais are not something &lsquo;Eternity&rsquo; tolerates, but this particular change does not instill unease in me.</p>

<p>Wan Ye: The sound of the waves and the rustling of fine leaves in bamboo groves bear a striking resemblance.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Ha, Wan Ye, I took the risk of sheltering you aboard this fleet not to listen to poetic musings.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I know, but this moonlight before the great battle is something neither of us should waste. (sighs softly) It would be perfect with a flask of sake.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: You mean, the great battle?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Yes. This scent in the wind, much like that night, signifies warning.</p>
<p>{Flashback scene}</p>
<p>{Wan Ye running}</p>
<p>Pursuer: Stop!</p>
<p>{Wan Ye halts}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (resigned sigh), Just one step away from the rendezvous port, and yet you still found me.</p>
<p>Pursuer: By the Sword Hunt Decree, hand over your swords.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: If you could make an exception for me, it might go smoother.</p>
<p>{Wan Ye pivots}{Pause for 1s}</p>
<p>Pursuer: (astonished) Maple leaf?</p>
<p>{Wan Ye draws his sword}</p>
<p>Pursuer: (cries out) Ahh! {Two voices here to indicate multiple pursuers}</p>
<p>{End of flashback}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Let&rsquo;s lower the sails, Sister Leader; it&rsquo;s time to brace for the storm.</p>
<p>[Sound of a large ship moving]</p>
<h3 id="act-v">Act V</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Strategist, Rogue</p>
<p>[Thunderclap][Ship anchors]</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Wan Ye, since you initiated this, you handle the liaison with the Resistance Army.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Alright. Sister Leader, take a stroll around the harbor and wait for my message.</p>
<p>{Wan Ye departs}</p>
<p>{Sister Leader wanders around}</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Huh? There&rsquo;s actually a poem written on this bulletin board: &ldquo;This body is like autumn leaves adrift across mountains and seas.&rdquo; Ha!</p>
<p>{Sister Leader writes on the bulletin board}</p>
<p>Sister Leader: We&rsquo;re back! Kid, write another poem!</p>
<p>Passerby: Hey, this is a bulletin board, not a message board.</p>
<p>Sister Leader: Hahaha. [Voice fades out]</p>
<p>{Wan Ye sits by the riverbank waiting for the Strategist}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Clouds disperse above high skies, revealing the reflection of home in the sunset glow. Mm, [flourish of his sleeve] the last line.</p>
<p>{An arrow whizzes by; Wan Ye dodges, arrow lands in water}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Honestly, I already lack poetic talent, and then to be interrupted like this.</p>
<p>{Wan Ye advances, his sword moves like a shadow, swiftly resolving the situation}</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Oh, I got it now. The last line is, &ldquo;A wanderer&rsquo;s heart drifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>{Strategist applauds}</p>
<p>Strategist: Wan Ye, you remain as sharp as ever. No wonder you escaped from the general&rsquo;s grasp; looks like our Resistance Army will gain a formidable warrior.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Strategist, you know why I&rsquo;ve come. Our Resistance Army gains more than just a warrior.</p>
<p>Strategist: What are your conditions?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Sister Leader&rsquo;s goal is simple: money and entertainment. As for me, I merely hope to advise the general, to share our way of the samurai.</p>
<p>Strategist: That royal court duel&hellip;</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I hold no grudge against the general. The winner gains an opportunity, the loser faces divine punishment – that&rsquo;s the rule. But our voices should be heard by the general.</p>
<p>Strategist: Our views align unexpectedly; we do not intend to provoke civil war. In the face of foreign threats, unity is paramount. However, the general&rsquo;s decisions have left many samurais disillusioned. We assembled into an army not to rebel, but to impose order and reduce chaos. Since the general no longer accepts royal court duels, we can only&hellip;</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I understand what Strategist intends. You hope to break through the heavily guarded imperial residence to directly advise the general.</p>
<p>Strategist: Exactly. Currently, our samurai forces are evenly matched with the military. We need an unforeseen force to influence the battle. Moreover, according to reliable intelligence, the general will personally lead the troops soon, and we can use this opportunity to show our resolve to her.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Resolve&hellip; I doubt the general would merely listen based on that alone. For us samurai, what is the original intention behind wielding our swords&hellip; {voice fades out}</p>
<h3 id="act-vi">Act VI</h3>
<p>Characters: Wan Ye, The General, Sister Leader, Strategist, Samurai, Soldiers</p>
<p>Scene: Battlefield</p>
<p>[Rendered battlefield][Thunderstorm sounds]</p>
<p>(Samurai forces are retreating)</p>
<p>Soldier A: The General is indeed extraordinary; upon her arrival on the battlefield, she commands like a deity, driving the Resistance Army into continuous retreat.</p>
<p>Soldier B: Indeed, with her here, it seems this turmoil is finally coming to an end!</p>
<p>General: Advance! Give the Resistance the final blow.</p>
<p>(Soldiers charge)</p>
<p>Strategist: Finally, my hidden soldiers.</p>
<p>(Pirates join the fray)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: You&rsquo;re quite patient, Strategist.</p>
<p>(Wan Ye and Sister Leader charge)</p>
<p>Sister Leader: I hope you can afford the price of hiring us, rebels.</p>
<p>(Wan Ye and Sister Leader are about to confront the General)</p>
<p>Soldier A: Not good, hurry and protect the General!</p>
<p>Soldier B: We can&rsquo;t extricate ourselves right now!</p>
<p>Sister Leader: General, let me behold your supreme martial skills.</p>
<p>General: Hmph, those who attempt to shatter eternity, show me your resolve.</p>
<p>(The General unsheathes her sword and slashes forward)</p>
<p>(Sister Leader retreats)</p>
<p>(The General strikes again) [Thunderclap]</p>
<p>(Flashback) Friend: There are always earthly creatures bold enough to face the might of thunderbolts.</p>
<p>(Wan Ye steps forward)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Sister Leader!</p>
<p>(Wan Ye blocks the General&rsquo;s strike)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (with effort)</p>
<p>Wan Ye&rsquo;s Thoughts: What expression would he have in that final moment?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (gathers strength)</p>
<p>(Wan Ye pushes the General&rsquo;s sword away)</p>
<p>General: (startled inhale)</p>
<p>General&rsquo;s Thoughts: That same expression once more.</p>
<p>(The General slashes again, pushing Wan Ye back)</p>
<p>(Wan Ye struggles to rise)</p>
<p>Wan Ye: (groans in pain)</p>
<p>(Soldiers surround them)</p>
<p>Soldier: General!</p>
<p>General: Stand aside for now.</p>
<p>(Soldiers retreat, the General approaches Wan Ye)</p>
<p>General: I remember you. The day a samurai challenged me in a royal court duel, I exacted punishment, and you, stole his sword. I marked you as a top priority target, yet you managed to elude capture.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Never meant to offend the General; there were extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>General: Your friend has fallen beneath my blade. And you, having witnessed the outcome of defiance firsthand, why persist on this path?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: General, it&rsquo;s not just me who&rsquo;s resolute. Most likely, we merely wish to safeguard our swords, our desires.</p>
<p>General: Desires? Has the ancient samurai spirit not been lost, leaving only empty shells of swordsmanship techniques? In this chaotic era, isn&rsquo;t a samurai wielding a sword only adding to the confusion? As a samurai from a noble house yourself, shouldn&rsquo;t you understand whether the true essence of the samurai code still exists within your family&rsquo;s teachings, let alone wandering samurais who might not comprehend the ethics they should adhere to?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: The General has a point; the samurai code is barely discernible in my family&rsquo;s teachings anymore. Through my travels and sparring with various samurais, I too have failed to find it.</p>
<p>General: Given this&hellip;</p>
<p>Wan Ye: Yet my dear friend, even in his vulnerability, sought opportunities for samurais. Despite the hardships, he chose to appeal alone. And the samurais, though begrudgingly, avoid unnecessary conflict and unite despite their differences.</p>
<p>General: So this is your perspective. What do you think samurai aspire to achieve with their swords?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: I believe it&rsquo;s the unwavering commitment to and propagation of the samurai ethos. Each samurai household possesses its unique traditions, hence the vast and complex samurai community. Every martial art needs its own lineage, and among them, swordsmanship is something that must never be forsaken, which is why the samurai react against the Sword Hunt Decree.</p>
<p>General: Even so, the scattered factions of samurai, each adhering to their distinct ways of swordsmanship, present an inherently unstable element, conflicting with the eternal peace I strive for.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: However, if utilized properly, the power of the samurai can also serve to protect eternity. Earlier, my friend asked me,</p>
<p>Wan Ye &amp; Friend: If one day our land is ravaged by disaster, and the people are no longer under the protection of the gods,</p>
<p>Friend: What would you choose to do?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: When our land is beset by disaster, a samurai would unhesitatingly uphold the moral principles they cherish. Upholding benevolence, righteousness, propriety, sincerity, honor, loyalty, and bravery - samurai pursue benevolence, thus even in defiance, they ensure not to harm the innocent populace; they pursue righteousness and propriety, therefore even in rebellion, they establish alliances openly and honorably; they strive for loyalty and bravery, thus never harboring intentions to usurp power. Samurais do not disdain the world, nor do they incite chaos; they wield not weapons of slaughter, but swords that breathe life into the samurai spirit, ultimately guarding the samurai way. The samurai spirit is not lost; rather, it lies dormant in the peaceful passage of generations, ready to awaken as an unparalleled force when called upon.</p>
<p>General&rsquo;s Thoughts: In this conflict, am I the only one escalating it?</p>
<p>Wan Ye: General, why do you pursue eternity?</p>
<p>General: (deep breath) My sister once promised eternity to her subjects, where time flows but nothing changes. Yet, she who promised eternity could not sustain it herself, sacrificing her life in the previous anti-invasion war, exchanging it for the peace that prevails until today. Taking her place as the ruler, I inherit her promise; as the highest and most revered figure, I must offer my people a dream, named Eternity. (pause) Do you feel the bitter pain every time you grasp your sword? Though the power of swords and blades can crush countless enemies and overcome numerous challenges, there are things that cannot be cleaved by swords, even she, who protected her people with her sword, was but a fleeting dream, vanishing suddenly.</p>
<p>Wan Ye: There is no escaping pain. Dreams may be ephemeral, but they possess the brightest colors. Humans are not immortal, yet they possess boundless potential. Disasters lurk everywhere, sacrifices occur at any moment, but those who sacrifice themselves illuminate the entire sky with their burning passion, while those who continue to carry dreams will keep forging ahead, protecting our land.</p>
<p>General: Perhaps you&rsquo;re right; the conflict should not continue. (sighs) Policy changes require careful consideration. For now, maintain the unity of the samurai league. (loudly) Withdraw the troops!</p>
<p>(The General departs)</p>
<p>General&rsquo;s Thoughts: Although her physical existence may vanish like a dream, she has transformed into the divine cherry blossom in our hearts, and perhaps that is also a form of eternity. [Rain sounds fade out]</p>
