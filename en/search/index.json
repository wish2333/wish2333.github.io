Origin and Evolution: Phase One: Biological Metaphor Phase. Richard Dawkins first introduced the concept of \u0026ldquo;meme\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;The Selfish Gene,\u0026rdquo; suggesting that information is transmitted through continual replication, with the basic unit facilitating this process being the replicator. Memes are replicators with the ability to copy themselves in the cultural evolutionary process. Memes primarily rely on self-replication and dissemination of content and form for propagation, leading to unpredictable cultural mutations.\nPhase Two: Cultural Theory Phase. Belgian scholar Héleène further developed meme theory, proposing that the lifecycle of memes includes stages such as assimilation, memory, expression, and transmission. In essence, after individuals receive and comprehend the content of memes, these memes are stored in the human brain. During the stage of information expression, individuals exhibit two attitudes towards memes: acceptance, leading to active editing and creation of new memes, and rejection, ensuring that old memes remain in individuals\u0026rsquo; minds, creating lasting memories. As individuals engage with meme culture, creating new memes and spreading them, memes infect new individuals, restarting this lifecycle.\nPhase Three: Internet Memes. Generally, digital content such as text, images, videos, etc., spread rapidly and widely on the internet, falls under the category of internet memes. Huffman views internet memes as \u0026ldquo;popular cultural units spread, imitated, and transformed by internet users, also created and shared by internet users.\u0026rdquo; Coleman defines internet memes as \u0026ldquo;infectious images, videos, and catchphrases that rapidly spread on the internet through continuous imitation and modification by users.\u0026rdquo; These definitions underscore that internet memes inherently exhibit significant variability, surpassing the realm of mere self-replication. The massive and atomized active participation of users is a crucial indicator of how internet memes come into being. Any internet user can become an anonymous creator of internet memes.\nInternet Meme: Specifically Refers to Memes Disseminated Through the Internet as a Medium Definition: These are infectious images, videos, and catchphrases rapidly spreading on the internet through continuous active imitation and modification by a large number of users. Source: Initial meme texts originate from platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, online live streaming, etc., excerpted from events or non-events. Form: After mutation, the structural forms vary widely, especially in GIFs, short videos; diverse grammatical structures, with statements and exclamations each accounting for 50%, leading to significant dissemination effects. Textual Features: Manifestation of subjectivity, projecting subjectivity through self-expression and expressions towards others, e.g., \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, but I am greatly impressed,\u0026rdquo; originating from director Ang Lee\u0026rsquo;s comment on the documentary \u0026ldquo;Bergman Island,\u0026rdquo; expressing his perplexity and astonishment at the documentary; \u0026ldquo;Shuan Q\u0026rdquo; reflects the subject\u0026rsquo;s speechless and mocking emotions towards the object. Cat Meme: The subject of study here pertains to video-based cat memes Definition: These are infectious videos featuring cats as creative material, rapidly spreading on the internet through continuous active imitation and modification. Uniqueness: Recently, these have gained popularity online, leading to a plethora of second creation videos, resulting in a distinctive phenomenon of dissemination. Example: 是不是你和女朋友旅游现状#猫meme的日常 #猫咪表情包 #恋爱日常 #Le - 抖音\n00后勇闯奇瑞汽车 编导岗区区涨一万粉丝嘛 年轻人会帮助年轻人的对吧00后整顿职场#猫meme - 抖音\n最恐怖的一集 #猫meme #猫咪 #人间真实 #生活 - 抖音\nMotivation for Research/Choice of Topic The use of emojis has become a popular means of online communication among internet users, especially among university students. Recently, there has been a surge in the production of cat memes on the internet, leading to a trend of creating short videos based on these cat memes. The prevalence of these cat meme-based videos as a youth subculture phenomenon revolving around internet symbols holds significant research value.\nInnovation:\nWhile the academic community has established a foundation in the study of emoji dissemination, with clear and in-depth research on their usage, dissemination phenomena, and interaction patterns, there is a lack of research on the use of emojis in the production of derivative videos. The factors influencing the participation of young people in the production or viewing of these derivative videos have not been adequately addressed. Therefore, this study focuses on the interactive behaviors and dissemination phenomena of young users in narrative derivative content, analyzing the motivations of this group.\nFeasibility:\nYoung people are the primary participants in the production of such derivative content.\n(If narrowed down to university students—proximity)\nResearch Questions Attention is needed on the characteristics and current status of derivative content: What narrative elements are present in cat meme derivative videos (such as plot design, character development, emotional construction)? How do cat meme derivative videos reflect characteristics of youth subculture? In what ways do the emoji symbols and language styles in cat meme derivative videos manifest? In empirical research, the following questions are to be explored: Starting from the perspective of dissemination effects and motivations:\nWhat motivates young people to engage in the production of cat meme derivative videos? How do these motivations relate to their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values? What are the dissemination effects of cat meme derivative videos? Which factors (such as innovativeness, emotional resonance, social engagement) influence the willingness of young people to watch and share them? Are there group differences in the viewing and creation of cat meme derivative videos among young people? How do factors like gender, age, and educational background affect their participation? Starting from influencing factors and mechanisms:\nHow do the characteristics of social networking platforms (such as algorithmic recommendations, interactive mechanisms) influence the popularity and dissemination of cat meme derivative videos? How do the narrative structure and content innovation of cat meme derivative videos promote or restrict their dissemination and acceptance among young people? How do viewing and creation behaviors of cat meme derivative videos form specific chains of interactive rituals within the young community, and how does this ritual promote cultural identity and group cohesion? Research Purpose and Significance Research Purpose Through quantitative research, to determine the willingness and motivations of young people to participate in cat meme derivative videos, thereby clarifying the dissemination effects of these videos among young people and potential influencing factors; through qualitative research, from the perspective of youth subculture, to further explore the rapid spread and popularization of cat memes as a new youth subcultural symbol, aiming to delve deeper into the connection between this innovative narrative mode and elements such as youth values, identity, and emotional appeals.\nResearch Significance:\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s society of rapid development in information technology and mobile internet technology, visual culture forms centered around images and videos have become the primary means through which people perceive and understand the world. Young people are faithful producers, consumers, and disseminators of visual culture, and visual culture, with its rich visuality and virtual reality pleasures, is loved by young people and significantly influences them. The spiritual core and value concepts carried by visual culture affect the value orientation and judgment of young people, serving as a force in shaping their values.\nThe emergence of cat meme derivative videos as a favored new visual cultural form among young people warrants study, not only for capturing real-time trends and filling certain practical gaps in youth subculture research academically, but also for making societal contributions by aiding in a better understanding of the cultural and psychological needs of young people, creating spaces of mutual respect, and leaving room for the next wave of innovative developments in youth subculture, thus possessing both research value and necessity.\nResearch Design (Research Methods and Content) Content Analysis Method Corresponding to the research questions:\nWhat narrative elements are present in cat meme remix videos (such as plot design, character development, emotional construction)? How do cat meme remix videos reflect characteristics of youth subculture? How do the emoticons and language style in cat meme remix videos manifest? Utilizing the content analysis method to analyze cat meme videos on the Bilibili platform. Sampling videos with the cat meme tag as the overall sampling frame, a certain number of cat meme videos will be selected based on their publication time. After obtaining the videos, they will be coded according to narrative elements, subcultural characteristics, emoticons, and language style as different categories, and the data will be processed.\nInterview Method Corresponding to the research questions:\nWhat motivates young people to participate in the production of cat meme remix videos? How do these motivations relate to their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values? Are there group differences in watching and creating cat meme remix videos among young people? How do factors such as gender, age, and educational background influence their participation? How does the narrative structure and content innovation of cat meme remix videos promote or limit their spread and acceptance among young people? Initially, through in-depth interviews, understanding the personal and social motivations of young people participating in the production of cat meme remix videos, including their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values. Additionally, conducting focus group discussions on the differences in watching and creating cat meme videos among young groups of different genders, ages, and educational backgrounds, to comprehend the social and cultural factors behind these differences. Simultaneously, discussing how the narrative and innovative content of cat meme remix videos influence the acceptance and dissemination among young people, especially how these factors affect the popularity and acceptance of the videos.\nTheoretical Framework Interaction Ritual Chains Theory: Proposed by the American sociologist Randall Collins, the Interaction Ritual Chains Theory posits that the study starts with situations, encounters composed of individuals, and micro-situations interlinked to form macro patterns. The network linking local situations is termed an \u0026ldquo;interaction ritual chain.\u0026rdquo; The components of an interaction ritual include: (1) two or more people gathered in the same place, (2) boundaries set for outsiders so participants know who is included and excluded, (3) attention focused on a common object or activity with mutual communication of this focus, and (4) sharing of common emotions or affective experiences. The acquisition of emotional energy is a key reason for individuals engaging in interaction rituals, a core element of interaction ritual chains. Both the creation and viewing of cat meme emoticon remix videos by young groups participate in the interaction ritual of this cultural symbol, craving identity affirmation and emotional resonance from others. Carnival Theory: The fundamental aspects of Bakhtin\u0026rsquo;s Carnival Theory can be summarized by three key terms: carnival, carnivalesque, and carnivalization. Carnival is a folk festival celebration, serving as the starting point and support for carnival theory, with values including the subversion of hierarchies and advocating equal dialogue. The carnivalesque is a symbolic code derived from cultural forms and meanings, categorized into four realms: (1) intimate contact allowed during the carnival, (2) playful banter as a mode of interaction, (3) an attitude of equal intimacy in life, and (4) vulgarity, representing a democratized lifestyle. Possessing characteristics of universality, ritualism, equality, and subversion, carnivalization originates from the carnival itself, with its artistic expression in literature and art termed carnivalization, eliminating any exclusivity and mutual disdain. As a multi-element, multimodal discourse, the meme as a language, with its strong narrative and visual appeal, has become the most favored form of expression among young people, embodying the universal characteristics of carnival, satisfying the public\u0026rsquo;s need for self-expression and political engagement. Dramaturgical Theory: Goffman\u0026rsquo;s Dramaturgical Theory posits that social interactions resemble theatrical performances, where individuals play various roles in daily life and present themselves in different ways. In this theory, the well-known concepts of frontstage and backstage are pivotal. The frontstage is the aspect intentionally displayed to others, while the backstage is where suppressed aspects reside, hidden from the audience\u0026rsquo;s view. Manipulating the frontstage and backstage constitutes \u0026ldquo;impression management.\u0026rdquo; Young groups utilize cat meme emoticons to narrate video content, presenting their \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; selves on the frontstage, while their undisclosed selves remain concealed in the backstage. For both the sender and receiver, the use of memes is not just an expression but also a performance, aiding individuals in shaping their ideal selves more effectively.

Integrating a Qt Designer-built interface with the Python programming language and leveraging the powerful ffmpeg tool, users can effortlessly specify video files, set cut points, and execute video processing tasks. The ultimate goal is to enhance video editing efficiency, particularly catering to users who require batch video processing.\nBrief Workflow Outline: Environment Setup Install necessary software and libraries: Ensure Python environment is properly configured, install PySide6, and ffmpeg.\nInterface Design (Using Qt Designer) Main Interface Design Design includes buttons for file selection (to choose video files), input fields for time trimming (for intro and outro removal times or direct cropping period), output path selection button, preview window (optional), start processing button, and progress bar. Convert the .ui file into .py.\nWriting Core Logic Code Read Video Information: Use ffmpeg to fetch video duration and other basic information. Time Processing: Based on user inputs, compute actual trimming command parameters (primarily end time). Invoke ffmpeg: Construct and execute ffmpeg command-line instructions for video slicing and joining. Progress Feedback: Implement logic to update progress bars, showcasing video processing advancement (may involve parsing ffmpeg output). Error Handling: Catch and handle errors during ffmpeg execution, providing user-friendly alerts. Binding Interface with Logic Code Utilize PySide\u0026rsquo;s signals and slots mechanism to connect interface elements (e.g., button click events) to backend processing logic.\nTesting \u0026amp; Debugging Thoroughly test the software for accurate video trimming and concatenation, responsive UI, and effective error handling mechanisms.\nOptimization \u0026amp; Aesthetics Adjust layout based on test feedback for an improved user experience; consider incorporating multithreading to enhance program responsiveness, especially when dealing with large files.\nPackaging \u0026amp; Deployment Package the application into an executable file (using tools like PyInstaller) for easy distribution and deployment, ensuring it runs smoothly on systems without a development environment.\nInterface Design Employ Qt Designer for interface design, including creating UI elements, layout adjustments, and setting component properties.\npyside6-uic input.ui -o output.py\rFrom main.py import ui from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication\rfrom output import Ui_MainWindow # 假设转换后生成的文件名为output.py\rclass MainWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):\rdef __init__(self):\rsuper().__init__()\rself.setupUi(self) # 初始化界面\r# 进一步设置信号槽和其他逻辑...\rif \u0026quot;__name__\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;:\rapp = QApplication(sys.argv)\rwindow = MainWindow()\rwindow.show()\rapp.exec_()\rCore Logic Code Implementation Setting FFmpeg Path (in config.py) import os\rclass ffpath:\r# 相对路径\rffmpeg_path_relative = '.\\\\FFmpeg\\\\bin\\\\ffmpeg.exe'\rffprobe_path_relative = '.\\\\FFmpeg\\\\bin\\\\ffprobe.exe'\r# 转换为绝对路径\rffmpeg_path = os.path.abspath(ffmpeg_path_relative)\rffprobe_path = os.path.abspath(ffprobe_path_relative)\rInitializing FFmpeg (in ffmpegApi.py) import subprocess\rimport os\r#import time\r# 从config.py中拿到ffmpeg.exe和ffprobe.exe的绝对路径\rfrom config import ffpath\rclass FFmpeg:\r# 初始化函数，用于初始化实例的ffmpeg_path属性\rdef __init__(self, ffmpeg_path):\rself.ffmpeg_path = ffmpeg_path\rDefining run Method to Invoke cmd (in ffmpegApi.py) While subprocess.Popen accepts a list, due to potential spaces and paths in FFmpeg commands that could lead to errors, we input as a string for reliability.\n# 定义run方法来执行FFmpeg命令\rdef run(self, cmd):\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\r执行给定的FFmpeg命令，并返回其输出。\r参数:\r- cmd: 一个列表，包含要执行的FFmpeg命令及其参数。\r返回值:\r- 执行命令的标准输出（字符串）。\r抛出:\r- Exception: 如果命令执行失败（返回码非0），则抛出包含错误信息的异常。\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rcmd = [self.ffmpeg_path] + cmd\rcmd_str = ' '.join(cmd)\rprint(f\u0026quot;尝试执行：{cmd_str}\u0026quot;)\rp = subprocess.Popen(cmd_str, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\rout, err = p.communicate()\rif p.returncode != 0:\rprint(f\u0026quot;命令执行失败，错误信息：{err.decode('utf-8')}\u0026quot;)\rraise Exception(err.decode('utf-8'))\rVideo Trimming (in ffmpegApi.py) definition of extract_video function:\ndef extract_video(self, input_folder, start_time, end, output_folder, encoder='-c:v copy -c:a copy'):\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\r获得FFmpeg命令的逻辑，给出具体的FFmpeg命令并传入run函数中运行\r参数：\rfolder：输入输出文件夹参数须为绝对路径字符串\rstart_time, end：片头片尾的持续时间参数须为H:mm:ss:fff格式的字符串\rencoder参数须为字符串，默认为'-c:v copy -c:a copy'复制流\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rUnder extract_video, define time_calculate to handle tail durations, given FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s inherent start-to-end trimming approach, requiring timestamp calculation based on the specified outro duration.\ndef time_calculate(duration, end):\r# 转换为浮点数进行计算\rhours, minutes, seconds_milliseconds = end.split(':')\rseconds, milliseconds = seconds_milliseconds.split('.')\rhours = float(hours)\rminutes = float(minutes)\rend_float = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + float(seconds)\rend_float += float(milliseconds) / 1000\rend_time_float = duration - end_float\rprint(\u0026quot;结束时间点为：\u0026quot;, end_time_float)\r# 浮点数结果转换为字符串格式\rm, s = divmod(end_time_float, 60)\rh, m = divmod(m, 60)\rend_time = \u0026quot;%02d:%02d:%06.3f\u0026quot; % (h, m, s)\rprint(\u0026quot;结束时间点为：\u0026quot;, end_time)\rreturn end_time\rCore in the extract_video function is using -accurate_seek, which, while not perfectly accurate, avoids errors, suitable for bulk operations.

We aim to identify the concrete manifestations of such inequalities within the particular community, encompassing aspects such as the distribution of infrastructure, allocation of public service facilities, and usage patterns of residential public spaces.\nResearch Background Social Space Social space is a central concept in urban sociology, profoundly developed and elucidated by French scholars such as Bourdieu and Lefebvre. Distinct from other concepts like social structure, social systems, and social networks, social space focuses on actors, their positions, and the relationships between them. It underscores the structural nature of social space and maintains close ties with Marxist theory.\nUrban ecology perspectives offer a different understanding of social space, seeing it as the setting where social interaction occurs, emphasizing the influence of social structures on individual behavior. Simmel views social space as having cohesiveness, conscious boundaries, and stresses the internal relations within space; for him, social distance transcends physical proximity, incorporating emotional dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Goffman further investigates how individuals organize their surrounding space through his work Behavior in public places: notes on the social organization of gatherings.①\nIn summary, social space is a complex and multi-dimensional concept that encompasses individuals, locations, interactions, and power dynamics. Diverse schools of thought and scholars interpret social space differently, providing rich perspectives for understanding urban social life.\nStudies on Social Space Previous studies have approached social space in various ways:\nThe multifaceted research paths on social space: Different scholars have proposed numerous research avenues, including community-based spatial sociology, situational spatial sociology, distributive spatial sociology, and productive spatial sociology. This diversity reflects the varied interests in different aspects and dimensions of social space.② The practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of space play pivotal roles across these diverse research paths.③\nTransformation and dilemmas of public space: Research on public space emphasizes its evolution and the challenges it faces. Public space has conceptual, social, and material attributes in social life. In the conduit society model, urban public spaces are categorized into regulatory and nodal types, serving as critical domains for power and capital regulation.④ Although public space loses its integrative functions over time and tends toward specialization in modern society, it retains the potential to connect disparate groups and carries real social space significance despite being shaped by power and capital dynamics.\nSocial space in the Chinese context: Within the Chinese context, social space research covers economic, political, and social changes in urban spaces. Institutional transformation, economic restructuring, and social structure changes jointly shape the evolution of urban spaces. This includes shifts in the role of urban governments, economically-driven spatial restructuring, and the balancing of commercial and civic values. Studies on urban space also highlight homogenization and instability, pointing to the socioeconomic dynamics in spatial transformations.⑤\nExploring these three research paths provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in social space research, contributing to the construction of a richer and more profound theoretical framework for social space.\nAfter a deep comprehension of social space theories and their research trajectories, we adopt an integrated research perspective. Social space is both a macroscopic view of actors, their positions, and structural relations between them, and a microscopic view of individual social interaction contexts.\nDrawing upon proximity and accessibility, we select Dingfuzhuang community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, for in-depth inquiry. Focusing on the unequal distribution and use of social space among different regions, neighborhoods, or specific sites, we aim to understand the concrete manifestations of these inequalities within the local community, such as the distribution of public service spaces, the use of residential public spaces, and the planning and development of industrial spaces. Not only concentrating on the practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of social space, but also considering the specific social and economic structures within the Chinese context, our goal is to accurately analyze the impact of social space inequality on residents\u0026rsquo; lives and social interactions.\nResearch Methods and Findings Literature Review Providing an Overview Spatial Concentration: From the perspectives of both Chaoyang District and Dingfuzhuang, public service spaces, residential public spaces, and industrial spaces all exhibit characteristics of concentration. This concentration phenomenon may lead to certain communities or areas enjoying a greater abundance of resources and services, while other regions relatively lack these amenities. Such unequal distribution of resources could potentially give rise to social inequality issues, impacting residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions.\nGreen Spaces in Suburbs: Similarly, green spaces are also concentrated in suburban locations with limited accessibility, which hinders their use by residents. The centralized distribution of suburban green spaces might result in some residents having difficulty accessing natural environments conveniently, thereby influencing their quality of life and social engagement.\nHorizontal Expansion, Vertical Decline: Dingfuzhuang is situated along the horizontal axis of Beijing, and within the urban planning of Chaoyang District, it is incorporated into the CBD-Dingfuzhuang Media and Cultural Industry Belt. This horizontal development axis has given rise to a pattern where social space in Dingfuzhuang experiences robust horizontal expansion but relative vertical decline. In this context, the horizontal dimension primarily represents the growth of industries and work flow, whereas the vertical dimension symbolizes human life trajectories and movement patterns. The emphasis on the horizontal aspect reflects, to a certain extent, the underemphasis on human-centric livability factors within this area.\nThus, we proceeded with field research and questionnaire surveys to delve deeper into the underlying situations and causes.\nField Research Reveals Nuanced Details Site Selection: In our field research, we focused extensively on areas found in the literature review to have high concentrations of public service spaces. Ultimately, we selected two representative residential communities, namely Dahuangzhuang Nanli and Dingfu Home, as well as the DREAM2049 International Cultural and Creative Industry Park and the Wando Technology \u0026amp; Culture Industry Park for in-depth investigation.\nAbsence of Youth in Public Spaces? Research Log: During the evening at the cultural square, young people seemed conspicuously absent; instead, seniors were predominantly engaged in activities such as playing cards, chess, and even using ping-pong tables for card games despite the heavy snow from the previous day. Fitness facilities remained largely unused. Strikingly, the crowd was mostly male, with only a few women interspersed among groups of men. One elderly couple was seen accompanying two children, with no other children present. The open space at Dahuangzhuang Nanli\u0026rsquo;s cultural square, closely connected to nearby residential neighborhoods, revealed a notable absence of young people, particularly those from the adjacent Communication University-affiliated secondary school. The commercial offerings in Jinyinbao Life further suggested that the place caters mainly to an older demographic. This asymmetry between proximity to youth congregation points and their lack of presence here prompted us to investigate this phenomenon further.\nOversized Residential Areas with Overconcentrated Commercial Spaces Research Log: Dingfu Estate, built near a subway station, inevitably exhibits Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)-related issues, most notably the clustering of commercial areas around the subway entrances. With its large scale, residents living far from the subway stations might find it challenging to fully access the related conveniences. Dingfu Home covers a vast area, and ground-level shops are densely distributed near subway exits or shared intersections, often leaving residents with just one or two shopping districts within walking distance, easily missed if they take the wrong route.\nCompared to Dahuangzhuang Nanli, Dingfu Home is newer and hosts more renters and young people. We observed that the residential estates here are enormous yet poorly interconnected. Consequently, social connections among residents in Dingfu Home are sparse. Furthermore, the overconcentration of businesses around the subway stations affects residents\u0026rsquo; ability to enjoy the full benefits of nearby commercial zones.\nSevere Imbalance in Road Traffic Pressure Research Log: Walking northwards through Dingfu Home South and then North, I noted that during the morning rush hour at around 9 am, the traffic on Chaoyang Road was bustling and noisy. However, upon diverting onto any perpendicular (north-south, or longitudinal) road, one would be surprised by the wide and sparsely occupied four-lane roads (such as Sanjianfang Middle Road). It raises the question of why such broad roads exist when the traffic demand seems lower.\nThe difference in traffic volume between longitudinal and transverse roads in the vicinity of Dingfu Home is striking. While transverse roads are packed with vehicles during peak hours, longitudinal roads are eerily quiet with only a few cars passing leisurely. This disparity highlights another issue: the government\u0026rsquo;s attention to transverse road construction seems to overshadow maintenance and improvement of longitudinal roads. This neglect leads to rampant illegal parking, piled-up snow along the roadside, and cyclists forced to navigate close to the center of these roads—a worrying situation for the \u0026rsquo;last mile\u0026rsquo; connectivity to homes. This imbalance calls into question whether the infrastructure truly prioritizes people\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nNotable \u0026ldquo;Tidal Ghost Town\u0026rdquo; Phenomenon Inside Industrial Parks Research Log: The overall impression of the industrial parks was that they felt desolate and unkempt, akin to a construction site hastily converted into a park with a few buildings erected. The parks had minimal landscaping, featuring merely a sparse line of pine trees every several meters. There were no outdoor recreational areas provided for employees within the parks, such as for sports, rest, or dining. The nearest park required a walk of over 40 minutes, rendering it practically inaccessible during working hours. The construction of parks seemed to prioritize residential areas, while the developers of the industrial parks failed to invest adequately in greening efforts. The employee experience, mental and physical health, and the provision of comfortable working environments appear to have been overlooked by society.\nThroughout Chaoyang District, numerous cultural and creative industry parks occupy significant urban space. Yet, these parks, which serve as new locales for Beijing\u0026rsquo;s cultural industry growth, suffer from a pronounced \u0026ldquo;tidal ghost town\u0026rdquo; phenomenon. Specifically, after sunset and as workers leave for home, these parks become deserted and inactive, with expansive squares left unused. As these parks take up considerable urban land, the question arises whether there are more rational strategies for spatial utilization that can ensure round-the-clock functionality and vibrancy.\nEmpirical Research Measuring Resident Perceptions Building upon the observations and details discovered in our field research, we further conducted empirical research utilizing questionnaires and in-depth interviews to gauge residents\u0026rsquo; actual perceptions. We distributed questionnaires to college students in Beijing, collecting 101 valid responses and three sets of in-depth interview materials. Additionally, we administered questionnaires to general Beijing residents, obtaining 524 valid responses. We will explore the resident perceptions reflected in the questionnaires through descriptive statistics.\nYoung People Are Not Absent, But Misaligned Our questionnaire data revealed that young people indeed frequent parks and malls. However, why are they scarcely seen in our observations at Dahuangzhuang Nanli? The reality is that residential public spaces and industrial zones often do not align with the preferences of younger demographics. An interviewee pointed out, \u0026ldquo;It feels like the nearby parks are for seniors; they don\u0026rsquo;t suit us.\u0026rdquo; This indicates that young people are not absent from the social space in Dingfuzhuang; rather, they are misaligned with the older population. While different groups having varied preferences is normal, our concern lies in the fact that across the three surveyed locations, covering a substantial area, various public spaces catering to diverse populations are not evenly distributed. This observation substantiates the conclusion regarding spatial concentration, highlighting an aspect requiring attention during urban planning.\nStrong Resident Perception of Social Space We note that social spaces, as interactive venues, are strongly perceived among residents. Parks and commercial plazas are frequently visited spaces, and notably, the subway system emerges as a frequented scene, reflecting alongside the deficiency in longitudinal transportation lines in Dingfuzhuang, an imbalance in the development of horizontal and vertical space flows in residents\u0026rsquo; lives.\nSummary This paper analyzes the current state of social space in Dingfuzhuang, Chaoyang District, Beijing, from a theoretical perspective of social space, uncovering issues such as uneven distribution of public service spaces, oversized residential areas coupled with overly concentrated commercial facilities, extreme and imbalanced traffic pressures, and the \u0026ldquo;tide-empty city\u0026rdquo; phenomenon within industrial parks. These problems not only affect residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions but also reflect irrationalities and unsustainability in urban planning and development.\nTo improve the social space in Dingfuzhuang and enhance its livability and vitality, we propose the following recommendations:\nIncrease the supply and distribution of public service spaces, especially within residential areas and surrounding industrial parks, providing more parks, libraries, museums, sports venues, etc., catering to the needs of residents across age groups and interests, fostering community cohesion and accumulation of social capital.\nAdjust the scale and structure of residential areas, reducing enclosed compounds and increasing open blocks to strengthen inter-residential connectivity and interaction, improving convenience and safety for residents\u0026rsquo; travel, and creating more humanistic and diversified living environments.\nBalance traffic pressure and distribution, optimizing the design and management of both horizontal and vertical roads, enhancing road usage efficiency and safety, promoting public transport and non-motorized vehicle use, reducing private car usage and parking, decreasing traffic congestion and pollution, and elevating the city\u0026rsquo;s greenness and aesthetic appeal.\nActivate the internal space utilization of industrial parks, adding greenery and leisure spaces within them, offering more cultural and creative activities to attract more young people and entrepreneurs, creating vibrant and innovative industrial parks, facilitating industrial transformation and upgrading, and strengthening the city\u0026rsquo;s competitiveness and influence.\nThrough these recommendations, we aim to bring about improvements and development to the social space in Dingfuzhuang, ultimately creating a better future for both its residents and the city itself.\nReferences 社会空间从齐美尔到戈夫曼，刘思达，2023 迈向什么样的空间社会学——城市社会学对象的四种路径与反思，营立成，2019 空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究，宗海勇，2018 秩序、利润与日常生活——公共空间生产及其困境，杨宇振，2018 社会空间和社会变迁——转型期城市研究的“社会—空间”转向，钟晓华，2013 View the document (CN)\n","date":"2023-12-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/zh/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/img5_hu30ed1aa73e227ae6d498d3fb11922757_176292_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/","title":"【Academic Research】Social Spatial Inequality within The Dingfuzhuang Community"},{"content":"Application Scenarios Online Course Editing:\nLegacy Courses: Batch update of intros and outros across varied formats (encoding, resolution, frame rate, audio format).

It is capable of handling tasks such as encoding, decoding, format conversion, editing, merging, extracting, compressing, decompressing, filtering, and subtitle handling for multimedia files. Compatible with various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.\nFFmpeg GUI Applications\nFortunately, we\u0026rsquo;re not confined to solely using command lines with FFmpeg anymore, as there are now several open-source graphical user interface (GUI) alternatives. Here are some noteworthy ones:\nLosslessCut\nSource Code: https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut Specifically designed for video trimming without batch processing capabilities. Allows marking multiple segments within a video and exporting them losslessly and swiftly. QuickCut\nSource Code: https://gitee.com/haujet/QuickCut Offers features like video compression, transcoding, reversing, concatenating clips, cutting based on subtitles, auto-subtitling, and automated editing. Not optimized for batch processing. Format Factory\nNote: Not open-source, and it\u0026rsquo;s advised not to download the latest version due to unwanted background activities. However, older versions remain functional. FFmpeg Batch AV Converter\nSource Code: https://github.com/eibol/ffmpeg_batch Enables batch trimming of video beginnings and endings based on duration, along with adding intro and outro sequences, although batch trimming might encounter issues. Batch Processing of Intros and Outros After testing numerous FFmpeg GUIs, many were found lacking in functionality, customization, or reliability, leaving no entirely satisfactory off-the-shelf software solution. Given FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s command-line nature, however, batch processing can be achieved through scripting. Here are some pre-existing scripts and resources:\n[Bat File + FFmpeg] Batch Video Splitting, Format Conversion, and Merging Requires no additional runtime libraries. Link to the video tutorial. [Windows] Batch Removal of Video Intros and Outros (FFmpeg + Shell Script) Requires installing the Git Bash tool. Original Post. Implementing Large Video Segmentation, Watermarking, and Intro/Outro Merging Using FFMPEG + Python Requires installing Python. Article Link. Ultimately, opting for the simplest approach led to choosing the Bat File + FFmpeg script solution. By referencing online resources and leveraging AI-generated code assistance, a tailored script was developed to fulfill the requirements.\nVideo Trimming Workflow Challenges in video trimming stem from FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s lack of reverse search capability, necessitating total video duration calculation for endpoint determination. Despite being straightforward, numerous GUIs falter when batch processing non-standard online course videos, potentially due to dynamic frame rates, audio inconsistencies, or GUI implementation issues, leading to errors or output videos with missing segments and audio-video sync problems. Ultimately, custom scripts proved most reliable for comprehensive video compatibility.\n@echo off\u0026amp;title MP4 批量掐头去尾（运行版）\rsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\recho 该脚本可以批量将目录内MP4文件，从头尾裁减固定时间。（如将多个视频，开头剪3s，结尾剪5s）\recho 如需批量指定视频的开始结束时间，请打开另一个脚本。（如指定多个视频，都从1分12秒开始，到5分27秒结束）\recho 如果您是从其他地方获取的该脚本，请先看一下b站视频，有详细介绍，谢谢。https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ic411N7ny/\recho 该脚本基于ffmpeg，请确保您已将ffmpeg添加到环境。\recho 时间作差部分依靠 @随风 @https://pokes.blog.csdn.net/\recho 获取视频文件时长借鉴 @亦良Cool @https://blog.csdn.net/annita2019/article/details/128747458\recho 作者虎啸ROAR b站：https://space.bilibili.com/19075528 个人网站：https://www.luotianyi.blue\rrem 提示用户输入开头裁剪的时间，或者跳过\recho 若当前选项为0，可直接按回车\rset /p sh=请输入开头切割的 小时部分（如开头无需切割，输入-1）:\rif \u0026quot;%sh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; goto zs if not \u0026quot;%sh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; goto os\r:zs\rset st=00:00:00.00\recho 开头裁剪时长 %st%\rgoto end\rexit\r:os\rrem 用户输入小时、分钟、秒和毫秒，设置开头裁剪时间\rset sh=00\rset /p sm=请输入开头切割的 分钟部分:\rif \u0026quot;%sm%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set sm=00\rset /p ss=请输入开头切割的 秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%ss%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set ss=00\rset /p sms=请输入开头切割的 毫秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%sms%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set sms=00\rset st=%sh%:%sm%:%ss%.%sms%\recho 开头裁剪时长 %st%\rgoto end\rexit\r:end\rrem 提示用户输入结尾裁剪的时间，或者跳过\rset /p eh=请输入结尾切割的 小时部分（如结尾无需切割，输入-1）:\rif \u0026quot;%eh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; ( goto ze) else ( goto oe)\rexit\r:ze\rset et=00:00:00.00\recho 结尾裁剪时长 %et%\rgoto fin\rexit\r:oe\rrem 用户输入小时、分钟、秒和毫秒，设置结尾裁剪时间\rset eh=00\rset /p em=请输入开头切割的 分钟部分:\rif \u0026quot;%em%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set em=00\rset /p es=请输入开头切割的 秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%es%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set es=00\rset /p ems=请输入开头切割的 毫秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%ems%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set ems=00\rset et=%eh%:%em%:%es%.%ems%\recho 结尾裁剪时长 %et%\rgoto fin\rexit\r:fin\rrem set st=0\rrem set et=00:00:02.80 rem 创建结果目录\rcd /d %~dp0\rmd result\rrem 对每个MP4文件进行裁剪\rfor /f \u0026quot;delims=\u0026quot; %%i in ('dir /b /s /a-d *.mp4') do (\rrem 获取视频持续时间\rfor /f \u0026quot;tokens=2 delims=, \u0026quot; %%a in ('ffmpeg -i \u0026quot;%%i\u0026quot; 2^\u0026gt;^\u0026amp;1 ^| find \u0026quot;Duration:\u0026quot;') do (\rset str=%%a\r)\rrem 设置裁剪结束时间为输入的结束时间\rset time=%et%:!str!\rset t=!time!\rcall :time0 \u0026quot;!t!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;!time!\u0026quot; ok\recho 本视频开始时间为 %st% 结束时间为：!ok!\rrem 执行裁剪操作\rffmpeg -ss %st% -to !ok! -accurate_seek -i \u0026quot;%%~si\u0026quot; -c:v copy -c:a copy \u0026quot;result\\%%~ni.mp4\u0026quot;\r)\rpause\rrem 将输入的时间转换为ffmpeg可识别的格式\r:time0 @echo off\u0026amp;setlocal\u0026amp;set /a n=0\rfor /f \u0026quot;tokens=1-8 delims=.: \u0026quot; %%a in (\u0026quot;%~1:%~2\u0026quot;) do (\rset /a n+=10%%a%%100*360000+10%%b%%100*6000+10%%c%%100*100+10%%d%%100\rset /a n-=10%%e%%100*360000+10%%f%%100*6000+10%%g%%100*100+10%%h%%100)\rset /a s=n/360000,n=n%%360000,f=n/6000,n=n%%6000,m=n/100,n=n%%100\rset \u0026quot;ok=%s%:%f%:%m%.%n%\u0026quot;\rendlocal\u0026amp;set %~3=%ok:-=%\rVideo Concatenation Workflow Video concatenation is easier theoretically, yet available references were scarce. As a programming novice, I utilized GPT-assisted learning to devise a failsafe concatenation strategy. FFmpeg offers two concatenation methods: direct concatenation for MPEG via concat protocol and universal concat demuxer, both supporting lossless and re-encoding. Testing revealed unpredictable outcomes when merging differently formatted videos.\nThe solution involved employing FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s filter_complex for re-encoding (lossy), preceded by uniform encoding settings adjustment to ensure consistency. This, while time-consuming, guaranteed reliability. Uniformity across frame rate, resolution, aspect ratio (ensuring 1:1 to avoid mismatches), audio sample rate, and channel count was crucial.\nrem 此为核心内容\rfor %a in (\u0026quot;*.mp4\u0026quot;) do\rffmpeg -i \u0026quot;.\\input\\op.mp4\u0026quot; -i %a -i .\\output\\ed.mp4\u0026quot; -filter_complex \u0026quot;[0:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v0];[1:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v1];[2:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v2];[0:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a0];[1:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a1];[2:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a2];[v0][a0][v1][a1][v2][a2]concat=n=3:v=1:a=1[vout][aout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[vout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[aout]\u0026quot; -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -ac 2 \u0026quot;!output_file!\u0026quot;\rrem 此为封装使用的文件源码\r@echo off\rsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\rrem 设置输入文件夹和输出文件夹路径\rset input_folder=input\rset output_folder=output\rrem 检查输出文件夹是否存在，如果不存在则创建\rif not exist !output_folder! mkdir !output_folder!\rrem 遍历当前目录的所有mp4文件\rfor %%a in (*.mp4) do (\rset input_file=%%a\rset output_file=!output_folder!\\%%~na.mp4\rrem 使用FFmpeg进行连接，调整编码参数\rffmpeg -i \u0026quot;!input_folder!\\op.mp4\u0026quot; -i \u0026quot;!input_file!\u0026quot; -i \u0026quot;!input_folder!\\ed.mp4\u0026quot; -filter_complex \u0026quot;[0:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v0];[1:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v1];[2:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v2];[0:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a0];[1:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a1];[2:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a2];[v0][a0][v1][a1][v2][a2]concat=n=3:v=1:a=1[vout][aout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[vout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[aout]\u0026quot; -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -ac 2 \u0026quot;!output_file!\u0026quot;\recho !output_file! created.\r)\recho All files processed.\rendlocal\rrem 这个命令的解释如下：\rrem 这个FFmpeg命令是用来合并视频文件的。具体来说，它首先会在当前目录下查找所有的mp4文件（使用通配符\u0026quot;*.mp4\u0026quot;来匹配），然后针对每一个文件执行以下操作：\rrem 执行ffmpeg命令，将当前目录下的op.mp4（在input目录下）作为第一个输入文件，将当前遍历到的mp4文件作为第二个输入文件，将当前目录下的ed.mp4（在input目录下）作为第三个输入文件。\r使用-filter_complex进行过滤操作。三个文件分别表示为[0:0], [0:1]；[1:0], [1:1]；[2:0], [2:1]，然后使用concat过滤器将它们拼接起来。n=3表示有三个输入流，v=1表示合并视频流，a=1表示合并音频流，合并后的视频流和音频流分别为[v]和[a]。\rrem 使用-map选项将拼接后的视频流和音频流分别映射到输出文件中。\rrem 设置视频编码器为libx264，使用预设，设置视频码率为800000，帧率为30。\rrem 设置音频编码器为aac，音频码率为192k，音频采样率为44100，声道数为2。\rrem 将合并后的视频和频流输出至output目录下，输出的文件名与原文件相同但扩展名为.mp4。\rRe-encoding parameters were tailored to specific needs.\n-c:v h264_nvenc -preset fast -b:v 800000 -r 30 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy\r-c:v h264_qsv -global_quality:v 22\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 256k\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 800000 -r 30 -c:a aac -b:a 256k\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 800000 -vf \u0026quot;scale=1280:-1\u0026quot; -c:a copy\rHandling Silent Segments Application Scenario: Removing pauses, waits, or stutters from long videos.\nImplementation Principle: Audio amplitude detection identifies silent parts, with XML export for further review, restoration, or edits.\nSolution 1: Automated Editing Tool A mature software product, iteratively refined for comprehensive functionality.\nSolution 2: FFmpeg Silence Detection\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=0.5 -vn -sn -dn -f null /dev/null\r# -af with silencedetect measures volume levels; compatible with specific audio formats.\r# noise sets the quiet threshold (default -60dB); d defines silence duration (default 2 seconds).\r# -vn, -sn, -dn ignore non-audio streams for efficiency.\r# On Windows, replace /dev/null with NUL.\r# For multi-channel audio, specify per-channel detection: ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af \u0026quot;silencedetect=mono=1\u0026quot;\r# For multi-channel audio, it is possible to specify detection for each channel individually.\rffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af \u0026quot;silencedetect=mono=1\u0026quot; -vn -sn -dn -f null /dev/null\rRapid Slicing \u0026amp; Inspection Details are omitted, but key points include:\nTranscribed text serves primarily for timestamp reference.

The text below encompasses the content of those segments, while the comprehensive full-text version is attached as a PDF file for your reference.\nAbstract This study focuses on the contemporary representative Internet new media platform Xiaohongshu APP, conducting a survey targeting college students in Beijing, employing quantitative research methods, integrating information adoption models with social influence theories, and utilizing SPSS for data analysis to examine the impact of online health information on users\u0026rsquo; adoption intentions. Through this investigation, the research aims to clarify how dimensions of perceived trust and perceived risk affect users\u0026rsquo; adoption willingness and to discern the roles played by information quality and hot level within the context of perceived trust.\nLiterature Review Research on User-Generated Content (UGC) User-Generated Content (UGC) emerged within the framework of Web 2.0, referring to user-driven participation in online platform development where they actively share and display their owned or created content. With the launch of video platform YouTube in 2005, the UGC model swiftly became a focal point in digital content evolution. Scholarly research on both theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of UGC has gradually burgeoned, leading to increased attention from various industries. New media platforms widely adopt the UGC model, relying on users for the integration and management of online resource information. [4]\nIn its early days, studies on UGC in new media primarily focused on video and blogging platforms. Sungmyung Huh [5] et al. employed the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory to investigate users\u0026rsquo; satisfaction and motivations behind using UGC platforms, asserting that self-expression constitutes a primary factor driving users to share and create videos on these platforms. Choi et al. [6] and Kim et al. [7], through their studies on video and blog platforms, posited that information interaction is a critical characteristic of UGC, emphasizing that user interfaces need to be designed adaptively to facilitate direct interaction between users and platform activities. Jae [8] also explored the effects of user control, synchronicity, and responsiveness on new media services and user information perception based on information interaction theories.\nAs mobile Internet became mainstream and the transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0 unfolded, the applicability of the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory came under scrutiny. Ichimizu Hoshi [9] analyzed four case studies related to UGC and argued that this theory overlooks the trend of audiences transitioning into communicators in the new media era, attempting to break away from traditional media analysis frameworks and presenting a thought-provoking critical perspective. Overall, UGC research in new media mainly concentrates on three dimensions: platform users, interactive content, and new media technologies.\nHealth Information Adoption Studies In 1948, when the World Health Organization was founded, health was defined as \u0026ldquo;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u0026rdquo;\nBroadly speaking, health information encompasses all knowledge, news, data, facts, and materials related to health or illness. With the widespread adoption of the internet and mobile devices, the boundaries of health information dissemination have expanded, barriers have been broken down, and the conventional healthcare environment has progressively transformed into an online space for exchange and sharing. The health information discussed in this study within the context of new media platforms refers to web-based health information broadly relating to people\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental health, illnesses, nutrition, wellness, and can be roughly categorized into two types: health and medical information and health lifestyle information. [10] In recent years, a series of user information behaviors associated with health information, such as searching, acquisition, evaluation, application, and feedback, have increasingly attracted attention.\nHealth information adoption refers to the aggregate of all stages of behavior from the acquisition to the utilization of health information by individuals. [11] Closely related concepts include information reception, which typically implies passive receipt of information, whereas information adoption emphasizes the proactive agency of the individual. Current research on health information adoption largely falls into two categories: one focusing on causes, investigating which factors influence individuals\u0026rsquo; adoption of health information, and another concentrating on outcomes, exploring the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors.\nTraditional research on health information adoption tends to lean towards the causal aspect. The classic Information Adoption Model (IAM) was proposed by Sussman and Siegal, who built upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), suggesting that information adoption behavior is mediated by perceived usefulness, which in turn is influenced by the quality of arguments and the credibility of information sources. [12] Subsequent studies on the influencing factors of health information adoption mostly base their investigations on this model. For instance, Deng Shengli et al., drawing from TAM2 and IAM, incorporated perceived risk into a new model and conducted empirical research on health information adoption among users of Q\u0026amp;A platforms through questionnaire surveys. [13] Additionally, other scholars have delved into alternative factors potentially affecting health information adoption. Mo Xiuting et al., for example, examined the influence of health self-efficacy on health information adoption, finding it could serve as both a moderator and mediator variable. [14] Han Xiaoxiao et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on health information adoption among urban elderly revealed that individual social capital impacts their health information adoption. [15]\nIn recent times, the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors has also garnered interest from researchers. Some scholars suggest that examining the relationship between changes in health behaviors and health information adoption can provide informational support for modifying individual health behaviors, effectively promoting the change of unhealthy behaviors and enhancing personal health management capabilities. [16] [17] Therefore, research on health information adoption is currently in a stage where both causality and outcome are considered equally important. [18]\nDomestic Research on Health Information Adoption on UGC Platforms Regarding health information adoption on video-based UGC platforms, Peng Sihao et al. [19] studied the communication characteristics of health-related short videos on Douyin (TikTok) and the factors influencing user information behavior. They found that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively affect user information behavior while perceived risk negatively influences it. In the process of disseminating health-related short videos, information quality, source credibility, users\u0026rsquo; health concerns, and subjective norms all exert positive effects on information adoption. Li Li et al. [20] established a research framework for the adoption of health-related short video information based on the Information Adoption Theory and the Heuristic-Systematic Model. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), they analyzed the effect paths of antecedent variables on user health information adoption and employed Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to explore the combined effects of influential conditions on short video users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption. SEM results showed that content quality, platform reputation, and source credibility significantly impact perceived usefulness, which in turn affects users\u0026rsquo; adoption intention; content quality and perceived usefulness act as chain mediators in the effect of expressiveness on adoption intention. fsQCA analysis revealed that users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption decisions on short videos are jointly influenced by systematic and heuristic cues. Wang Xinglan et al. [21] constructed a theoretical model based on the Uses and Gratifications Theory, Health Belief Model, and Elaboration Likelihood Model, discovering that social gratification needs, learning gratification needs, perceived health threats, and perceived health expectations positively influence information adoption behavior, while argument quality, source credibility, and video appeal indirectly affect information adoption.\nIn the context of specialized online health communities, Liu Zhu [22] introduced perceived trust as a mediating variable and used information quality and information popularity derived from conformity theory to measure users\u0026rsquo; perceived trust. Perceived risk was used as an independent variable affecting both perceived trust and user information adoption, with health self-efficacy serving as another independent variable influencing user information adoption. Findings suggested that information quality (source reliability, information accuracy, and timeliness) significantly positively impacts perceived trust; information popularity significantly positively influences perceived trust; perceived risk significantly negatively affects perceived trust but does not significantly influence user information adoption; both perceived trust and health self-efficacy positively and significantly affect user information adoption. Perceived trust partially mediates the relationship between information quality and user information adoption, and fully mediates the relationship between information popularity and user information adoption. Zhu Yunqin et al. [23] utilized the Elaboration Likelihood Model combined with Information Need Theory to examine how high-level central processing (information quality) and low-level peripheral processing (carrier quality and source credibility) in an online health community environment affect users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness, subsequently influencing their information search behavior. Their findings indicated that for peripheral processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by source credibility and carrier quality; for central processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by information quality. Moreover, the relationships between information quality and source credibility with users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness are negatively moderated by the motivational variable of information need.\nResearch Methodology Research Hypotheses Based on the theory of health self-efficacy, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH1: Health self-efficacy among college students positively affects their health information adoption.\nConsidering that health information quality comprises aspects like accuracy and timeliness [33], and taking into account the strong emotional nature of content expression on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), this study adds information emotional intensity to the concept of information quality. Drawing from relevant theories of the Information Adoption Model, the following hypotheses are put forward:\nH2: The quality of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2a: The emotional intensity of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2b: The accuracy of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2c: The timeliness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nDrawing from theories related to the Information Adoption Model and referencing Chou et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on source credibility, the following hypotheses are presented:\nH3: The credibility of health information sources on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3a: The credibility of health information providers on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3b: The platform credibility of Xiaohongshu positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nGrounded in Social Influence Theory, the following hypotheses are advanced:\nH4: Social influence of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4a: User consensus on health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4b: The popularity or information热度 of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nConsistent with the Information Adoption Model, the final hypothesis is:\nH5: College students\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences their health information adoption.\nQuestionnaire Structure Design The survey questionnaire consists of two main sections: a Likert scale section and a section collecting basic information about the respondents. The Likert-scale portion is structured as a matrix with 3-6 items designed for each dimension based on the research model and hypotheses. The basic information section primarily gathers data on the gender, educational level, and major of the respondents.\nPast studies have shown that medical and social science majors exhibit relatively higher levels of media literacy when processing and accepting information, with no significant statistical differences observed among other majors. Consequently, this study targets college students from medical, social science, and other majors, administering the same standardized questionnaire across three independent surveys.\nThe research questionnaire is divided into three parts:\nIntroduction: This part outlines the purpose of the survey, assures confidentiality of responses, and expresses gratitude to the participants. It also defines the scope and definition of health information before filtering out participants who have browsed or read health information on Xiaohongshu, focusing primarily on those who have had exposure to such content. Core Content: This section contains the heart of the questionnaire, measuring five constructs within the research model through 37 measurement items: Health Self-Efficacy (5 items) Information Quality (10 items): Information Emotional Intensity (4 items) Information Accuracy (3 items) Information Timeliness (3 items) Source Credibility (7 items): Platform Credibility (3 items) Provider Credibility (4 items) Social Influence (6 items): User Consensus (2 items) Information Popularity (4 items) Perceived Usefulness (4 items) Health Information Adoption (5 items) All measurement items utilize a 5-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neutral, 4: agree, 5: strongly agree). Personal Information: This part collects demographic details, including gender, academic status, and specific field of study. Pilot Survey and Questionnaire Revision The pilot questionnaire consisted of 15 questions, including 11 Likert scale items and 4 personal information questions. A pilot survey was conducted among university students in Beijing, resulting in 123 questionnaires distributed and 73 valid responses, giving an effective return rate of 59.35%. Based on the pilot survey data analysis, several improvements were made:\nSince there was almost no correlation between the respondent\u0026rsquo;s school and their usage or adoption behaviors, the item asking about the \u0026ldquo;school attended\u0026rdquo; was removed. Instead, the \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; question was refined to provide clearer and more precise options. Some items in the Likert scale had low factor loadings or lacked specificity, indicating low effectiveness. Such invalid items were eliminated from the final questionnaire. The revised formal questionnaire comprised 11 matrix Likert scale sets and 3 basic information questions, with a reduction in the number of questions within the matrices and improved clarity and consistency in their phrasing and logical sequence.\nFormal Sampling Survey For the formal survey, three criteria were set for selecting participants: (1) they must have used the Xiaohongshu platform, (2) they must have a certain degree of interest in health information, and (3) they must be currently enrolled college students. Through snowball sampling, eligible participants were asked to recommend others who met these requirements.\nBased on 2021 data released by the Ministry of Education on the number of undergraduate students by discipline category, the ratio of students in the medical category to those in four other categories (law, education, management, and economics) was approximately 1:4. This ratio was approximated for the Beijing student population to ensure a consistent sample size ratio in the two comparative studies.\nThe formal survey began on June 19, 2023, and ended on June 25, 2023, lasting for seven days. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed, 281 were returned, and 174 were deemed valid, yielding an effective recovery rate of 61.92%.\nThe data analysis section is omitted here; please refer to the attachment for details.\nReferences(partially) [4] 范哲, 朱庆华, 赵宇翔.

Throughout the series, it featured both bizarre incidents that left viewers laughing and crying, as well as thrilling on-site arrests, showcasing both the stern and rigorous law enforcement procedures and heartwarming grassroots services. Behind the hustle and bustle, the guardians never rest; in recent years, documentaries focusing on law enforcement have increasingly attracted the younger generation. Today, let us take a step into these \u0026ldquo;outposts\u0026rdquo; that serve and protect the people, gaining an understanding of the most authentic front lines of police work.\nGuarding Liberation West The Guarding Liberation West series is a legal education documentary centered around the daily work of police officers in Changsha, Hunan Province. This documentary deeply showcases the routine tasks of urban police officers in the central business district of a metropolis, revealing the intricate interplay of law, reason, emotion, and reality within complex policing situations through activities such as police patrols, multi-departmental cooperation, suspect interrogations, and involvement in major cases. It portrays a vivid image of responsible, rational, and compassionate police officers, and disseminates relevant safety and legal knowledge to the public through various case stories. The featured police officers in the show have distinct characteristics, each with their own areas of expertise and endearing personalities, which constitutes one of the main attractions of Guarding Liberation West.\nThanks to the rich experience of Hunan TV in producing variety shows, and due to the everyday, relatable nature of the cases depicted in Guarding Liberation West, the program infuses a certain level of entertainment into the rigorous process of law enforcement, ensuring seriousness while also catering to viewers\u0026rsquo; preferences for amusement. In the bar and commercial districts, an abundance of civil disturbances resulting from alcohol consumption serve as a recurring thread throughout the three episodes. Incidents under the influence of alcohol can sometimes jeopardize public safety, create misunderstandings, appear absurdly comical, or lead to tragedies. The show captures life\u0026rsquo;s nuances vividly in minor incidents while maintaining strict rigor in significant matters, providing viewers with a delightful viewing experience.\nGuarding Liberation West is filled with wit, humor, and laugh-out-loud moments, telling stories of human life and its vicissitudes in the Liberation West area of Changsha, portraying the spirit, unique personalities, and selfless dedication of grassroots police officers in the new era. While conducting serious legal education, it also offers a sense of relaxation and enjoyment, making it an essential companion during meals.\nBig City, No Small Matters Big City, No Small Matters is a police documentary produced by Oriental Satellite TV. Unlike Guarding Liberation West, this program shifts its focus from grassroots police station affairs to the actions against crime, concentrating on criminal and economic cases in Shanghai (referred to as \u0026lsquo;Shen City\u0026rsquo;). The show embeds itself within various criminal investigation and economic investigation teams across Shanghai, closely following the processes of solving cases involving forensic science, anti-theft, anti-fraud, plainclothes operations, major cases, and drug enforcement. Viewers can experience the intensity firsthand through the lens, accompanying law enforcement officers to the front lines of capturing suspects, immersively feeling the tense atmosphere and recreating the thrilling moments of apprehension.\nCriminal and economic crimes are more serious and hardcore compared to civil cases. This series covers not only recurring heinous acts such as drug trafficking and tax evasion but also new forms of crime like online and telecommunications fraud. The show particularly highlights these novel criminal methods, serving as a stark reminder that \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rsquo;s net is vast and though it may have gaps, none can escape.\u0026rdquo; It further embodies the professional attitude of investigative teams who constantly monitor and vigilantly protect society. A thought-provoking aspect is that a significant number of suspects involved in online fraud are young people adept at internet technology, yet often lack knowledge about relevant laws, only realizing they\u0026rsquo;ve broken the law upon arrest. This underscores the importance of economic legal education. Concurrently, elderly individuals are more susceptible to falling victim to online scams, making it an urgent social development issue to integrate this demographic into an increasingly digital payment-dominated environment.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re drawn to the hardcore elements of criminal and economic investigations, eager to explore the strategies behind cracking major cases, or simply wish to experience the adrenaline rush of frontline law enforcement, Big City, No Small Matters might just be the perfect fit for you.\nForensic Files Forensic Files is a police documentary produced by China Central Television, which uses a series of classic cases as a vehicle to narrate the entire process of case investigation from the perspective of forensic experts, tightly integrating criminalistics with detective work. Although the program mainly tells the story through the eyes of forensic experts, it presents a comprehensive view of all stages from identification to apprehension, featuring a tight pace and interlocking clues and motives, creating a strong sense of deduction that is both suspenseful and captivating.\nThe show particularly highlights the forensic criminal investigation techniques, which are highly specialized and core content. For instance, regarding the concept of time of death, Forensic Files provides detailed explanations: how forensic experts use specific methods to accurately estimate the time of death for victims, thereby providing solid evidence for detectives to solve cases.\nUnder the scalpel, the last words of the victims are conveyed; under the microscope, the wrongdoings of criminals are exposed. Forensic Files guides viewers to unravel the intricate details of cases, revealing all hidden truths. While solving cases, the program also conveys the noble professional spirit of forensic experts, who speak for the deceased and advocate for the rights of the living.\nObserving the dynamics of society, safeguarding local tranquility. Grassroots police officers, criminal investigation officers, and economic crime investigation officers jointly maintain the peace of the city, piecing together the truth like a puzzle, breaking through barriers amidst confusion to pinpoint the source of evil. You may rarely encounter them, but more often than not, they blend into the hustle and bustle of urban life and the everyday routines of the marketplace. In times of urgent police situations, they are the brave ones going against the tide; after the storm has passed, they shine as the most dazzling light in the sky above the city. Their brilliance may be hidden in the ordinary, yet their true colors still shine through even in understated ways.\n“Guarding Liberation West” “Forensic Files” “Guarding Liberation West” “Big City, No Small Matters” ","date":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/the-cold-and-warmth-of-the-police-station/t019aad1f5548ec9421_hu8e26b2051a5a96b9128394306a827e9c_280494_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/the-cold-and-warmth-of-the-police-station/","title":"The Cold and Warmth of the Police Station"},{"content":"Seagulls silent, traveler\u0026rsquo;s sentiment; red leaves aflame, heart of benevolence and righteousness. Setting Disclaimer: This is a derivative creation, all copyrights belong to miHoYo.\nAll plot elements are purely fictional and unrelated to any historical figures or nations.\nIntroduction In a time of extreme instability across the globe, the General suddenly issued a Sword Hunt Decree, ordering the confiscation of swords carried by civilians, which incited discontent among various samurai factions and civilian organizations, leading them to unite and form a resistance army. Despite being intended to stabilize society, this decision only exacerbated social unrest. Amidst the chaos, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend bravely ventured forth alone to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at the Imperial Court, witnessing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen figure. Forced to flee with his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, Wanye inherited his friend\u0026rsquo;s legacy and was rescued by pirates during his pursuit, ultimately fostering collaboration between the pirates and the resistance army. Raising the banner of rebellion, Wanye finally stood before the General, using his sense of righteousness to illustrate the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nCharacter Settings Wanye: A wandering samurai hailing from a once-proud but now destitute samurai family. Courteous in demeanor, gentle yet romantic, he enjoys composing poetry and displays the carefree spirit of a rōnin while nurturing a deep compassion for the suffering of all living beings. He remains calm and contented, cherishing nature and possessing acute hearing and exceptional martial prowess, especially fond of maple leaves. His voice quality is youthful, primarily resonating in the larynx with a hint of chest resonance; his pronunciation originates near the hard palate. Friend: A wandering samurai characterized by his open and bold personality, determined and valiant, with a heart set on sacrificing himself to save others. Skilled in martial arts, he believes himself to be the one capable of standing before the General to remonstrate, choosing to do so single-handedly, ultimately falling in combat within the Imperial Court but leaving a lasting impact through his courage and sense of righteousness. The General: The ruler, revered by the populace as a War God, having undergone significant personal changes following multiple wars where her loved ones perished, gradually becoming detached from the people. She pursued the concept of \u0026ldquo;eternal immutability\u0026rdquo; and enacted the Sword Hunt Decree to maintain national stability. Eventually, she comes to realize the decree\u0026rsquo;s irrationality under the influence of Wanye and his friend. Big Sister: The leader of the pirate gang, known for her bold and straightforward demeanor. She particularly appreciates Wanye\u0026rsquo;s poetic talents. Strategist: The leader of the resistance army advocating for the right of civilians to carry swords, believing that the collective power of the people could sway the General\u0026rsquo;s stance. [Voice acting guidance for each character should refer to the original game soundtrack.]\nOutline Act 1: The Encounter of Wanye and His Friend Act 2: Conversation Aboard the Ship Act 3: The Early Stages of the Sword Hunt Decree - The Friend\u0026rsquo;s Remonstration and Departure Act 4: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Fugitive Experience Act 5: Pirates and the Resistance Army Act 6: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Advice Finale: Wanye Honors His Friend Synopsis During a period of intense global instability, the General unexpectedly instigated a Sword Hunt Decree, aiming to collect privately-owned swords, causing dissatisfaction among various samurais and civilian groups, who consequently coalesced into a resistance force. The policy, initially designed to stabilize the nation, instead triggered massive societal upheaval. In the tumultuous times, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend ventured solo to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at court, seeing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen silhouette. Taking his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and fleeing, Wanye, inheriting his friend\u0026rsquo;s aspirations, united with pirates during his escape, leading to cooperation between pirates and the resistance army. Ultimately, he faced the General with a compassionate heart, demonstrating the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPlay Act I: The Sleeve Fluttering in Autumn Wind Asking for Red Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Acquaintance\nSetting: A forest clearing in the wilderness\n[Environmental Sounds] {Wan Ye kneels down to play a leaf whistle, finishing with reciting poetry}\nWan Ye: Traversing the deep mountains amidst red leaves, my ears ask after deer’s song. [Brief rustling wind sound]\n{Wan Ye sits up, flutters his sleeves, accompanied by the sound of fabric swaying and unsheathing a blade}\nWan Ye: Who approaches?\n{The Acquaintance enters from behind Wan Ye}\nAcquaintance: No need to be so tense, little brother. (pauses for 1 second) Your clothes may seem tattered at first glance, but the design is incredibly intricate. If I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken, the maple leaf pattern on your attire is your family crest, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nWan Ye: So what if it is? Are you here to rob me, or to duel?\nAcquaintance: Haha, maybe just to compare swords. {Both draw their blades and charge towards each other}\n[Sounds of footsteps][Clashing of blades]\nWan Ye and Acquaintance: (grunting and exerting effort during the sword exchange)\nWan Ye: Huh {Wan Ye parries the blade}[Their swords lock momentarily]\nAcquaintance: Good swordsmanship! (laughs) How did you manage to spot me just now?\nWan Ye: I can hear the wind\u0026rsquo;s voice, and it grew unusually restless just now, suggesting you\u0026rsquo;re someone who can\u0026rsquo;t keep still. Yet, I also detect no malice in you.\nAcquaintance: Haha, even though you sensed no ill intent, your strike was quite fierce.\nWan Ye: When comparing swords, one naturally gives it their all; otherwise, how could we justify the stirring of the wind. But I believe that chance encounters have their own significance. My name is Wan Ye, and yours?\n{Sound fades out as the memory ends}\n[End of Flashback]\nAct II: The Oceanic Gale That Hurts Maple Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Acquaintance\nSetting: Onboard a ship\n[Gradually intensifying sea breeze] {Wan Ye wakes up from a dream, feeling a bit of a headache}\n(Allow breathing sounds for 2 seconds)\nWan Ye: Ah (sighs)\n{Sister Leader walks up to engage in conversation, footsteps on wooden deck}\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, we\u0026rsquo;re about to set sail soon. What are you daydreaming about here?\nWan Ye: Just reminiscing about some past events.\nSister Leader: Speaking of past events, I really did bring this unknown and potentially dangerous element onto the ship.\nWan Ye: (chuckles lightly) Sister Leader, you jest. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t time before to explain. (pauses for 1 second) My past\u0026hellip; the most memorable part was when I lived as a wandering samurai, drifting without roots, no fixed abode, yet there were benefits. Staying too long in one place would create a distance between me and nature. Perhaps wandering is indeed the lifestyle most suited for me.\nSister Leader: Wandering and drifting, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like our life on this ship, sailing with the waves, never anchoring for long at any port.\nWan Ye: But my life might be more akin to a maple leaf dancing in the wind, unattached to anything, free from burdens and attachments, acquainting myself with all things under heaven and earth, inhaling the essence of the four directions—this is the state I enjoy.\nSister Leader: Why the maple leaf?\nWan Ye: I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an affinity for maple leaves, though they often symbolize partings during their crimson season.\nSister Leader: But the red leaves are like fire, passionate and radiant.\nWan Ye: Yes, indeed they are.\nSister Leader: I have another question—how did a wanderer like you end up being wanted by your lord?\nWan Ye: {Wan Ye lifts his sword} That story begins with the owner of this very sword.\nAct III: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Passerby\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: He used to be my closest friend. That day he asked me about\u0026hellip; {soliloquy fades out}\n[Natural sounds, bird calls, etc.] {Wan Ye practices swordplay with his friend, both panting slightly afterwards}\nFriend: Wan Ye, have you ever heard of the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;?[Cat meows] {Wan Ye pets the cat}\nWan Ye: Of course, such a blade is only seen during divine retribution. It represents the pinnacle of the general\u0026rsquo;s martial arts prowess, symbolizing ultimate strength.\nFriend: However, that blade may not be entirely unattainable. There are living beings on earth who dare to face the might of thunderbolts.\nWan Ye: Nonetheless, currently, my swordsmanship cannot compare to that of the general.\nFriend: Haha, aiming for it is still a worthy goal nonetheless.\nWan Ye: (light chuckle) Mm.\nFriend: I will dedicate my life to pursuing the utmost limit of martial arts, to confront that \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;.\nWan Ye: But I\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered, why do we travel far and wide, honing our swordsmanship? What does a samurai\u0026rsquo;s sword truly mean? Before my wandering days, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the meaning of swordsmanship within the remnants of my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings.\nFriend: Wan Ye, if someday our land is eroded by calamity, and its people are no longer under the watchful eye of the gods, what choice would you make?\nWan Ye: I suppose I\u0026rsquo;d choose to live a life of anonymity.\nFriend: Humph, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. {pats Wan Ye\u0026rsquo;s shoulder}\nWan Ye: Huh? [Cat meows]\n{Friend departs}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: Later, unexpectedly, the Sword Hunt Decree came into effect, and the people\u0026rsquo;s wishes gradually became bricks and mortar for constructing \u0026ldquo;eternity\u0026rdquo;. {soliloquy fades out}\n[Light rain] {Wan Ye walks down the street}\nPasserby A: (whispering) Have you heard about the Sword Hunt Decree\u0026hellip;\nPasserby B: Yeah, these days soldiers patrol the streets frequently, and occasionally you can hear the distant sound of swords clashing.\nPasserby A: It\u0026rsquo;s said that some samurais have formed a resistance army, demanding the repeal of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPasserby B: Actually, issuing the Sword Hunt Decree at this time\u0026hellip; {voice trails off}\nSamurai A: (whispering) What should we do in this situation?\nSamurai B: Maybe we should just surrender our swords obediently.\nSamurai A: (barely containing anger) How could we? The sword is\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Fleeing reluctantly, amidst flashing blades and tumultuous journeys, the land now sees samurai\u0026rsquo;s aspirations ruthlessly stripped away. Enduring warfare perplexes me, whether it\u0026rsquo;s due to samurai\u0026rsquo;s obstinacy or sudden policy shifts.\n{While Wan Ye contemplates, Passersby C and D discuss the Friend}\nPasserby C: There are unusually few patrolling soldiers today.\nPasserby D: Word has it that a wandering samurai challenged the general in a royal court duel today, which is why most soldiers are maintaining order. {Wan Ye stops, exhales heavily}\nPasserby C: This samurai is indeed brave. Challenging the general in a royal court duel is the sole means to demand change from those pursuing eternity, but failure means certain death.\nPasserby D: To defy the dignity of the \u0026lsquo;God of War\u0026rsquo; takes real courage.\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Could it be him\u0026hellip;\n{Wan Ye turns and sprints towards the royal palace} [Rain and footsteps fade out]\n[Rain and thunder sounds]\n{Wan Ye runs up the steps, panting}\n[At the moment Wan Ye reaches the royal court, lightning strikes, and the Friend falls]\nWan Ye: (inhales sharply in shock)\n{Wan Ye rushes forward to embrace the fallen Friend} [Hugging sound followed by the sound of the sword falling]\nWan Ye: (clenching teeth) {Wan Ye picks up his Friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and escapes, ending with the sound of getting up}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: The royal court duel is solemn and brutal; the loser faces divine punishment while the winner earns a turning point. Perhaps he thought himself the best candidate to stand up. Confronting the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; was his lifelong pursuit. When I arrived, the duel had ended, and all I heard was the sound of his sword hitting the ground after \u0026lsquo;divine retribution\u0026rsquo;. That must have been the radiance he sought to witness. In his final moments, what expression graced his face? There was no time to ponder; I seized his sword and fled. All I knew was that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t let his fervent wish be cast into a cold statue. {soliloquy ends}\nAfter the Third Act: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader\nSetting: Onboard the ship\nSister Leader: Your friend is truly admirable. Despite having different beliefs and ideals, you two conversed harmoniously, making it indeed a fateful encounter as you mentioned.\nWan Ye: Although I\u0026rsquo;ve never fully understood what samurais stubbornly pursue, upon picking up my friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, I finally comprehended his aspirations and convictions, and realized the significance of starting a journey with the sword for a samurai.\nSister Leader: You think this conviction must be witnessed by the general herself, hence why you convinced me to accept the resistance army\u0026rsquo;s employment.\nWan Ye: Sister Leader, you\u0026rsquo;re perceptive indeed. Even though you know of my personal motive, you won\u0026rsquo;t refuse this employment anymore.\nSister Leader: Such a fiery desire – I\u0026rsquo;m also curious whether it can shake the \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; upheld by the general.\nWan Ye: Many times, I questioned myself if my discontent with the general stemmed from that royal court duel or her decisive strike against my friend. But I realize it\u0026rsquo;s not that; I simply want righteousness to be met with righteousness. Is the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; truly unattainable? Perhaps one day, we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to confront that kind of overwhelming power, which is precisely why I want to return.\nConclusion of the Previous Episode Characters: The General\nSetting: Silent Royal Palace\nGeneral: Amidst this fleeting world, not only dreams can manifest in slumber; everything is ephemeral. The world is like a dream, and only \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; can protect all sentient beings. Desires are perhaps the most unstable factor. But, much like then, he charged forth fearlessly, much like you, sister.\nPrevious Episode Ends\nNext Episode Opening Characters: The General, Attendant\nSetting: Silent Imperial Residence\nGeneral: What is the current battle situation?\nAttendant: We\u0026rsquo;re still at a standoff; there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been an opportunity to wipe out the Resistance Army in one fell swoop.\nGeneral: (pondering) Hmm. Ordinarily isolated samurais have managed to form an alliance, despite differing philosophies. How have these diverse individuals come together and achieved a unity that rivals the military\u0026rsquo;s might? Such power cannot be ignored.\nAttendant: What orders do you have, General?\nGeneral: I will set out tomorrow to quell the Resistance Army. You may withdraw for now.\nAttendant: Understood. {Attendant retreats}\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Soliloquy: Changes brought about by samurais are not something \u0026lsquo;Eternity\u0026rsquo; tolerates, but this particular change does not instill unease in me.\nAct IV Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Pursuers\n[Sea Breeze][Flapping of sails][Surf Sound]\nWan Ye: The sound of the waves and the rustling of fine leaves in bamboo groves bear a striking resemblance.\nSister Leader: Ha, Wan Ye, I took the risk of sheltering you aboard this fleet not to listen to poetic musings.\nWan Ye: I know, but this moonlight before the great battle is something neither of us should waste. (sighs softly) It would be perfect with a flask of sake.\nSister Leader: You mean, the great battle?\nWan Ye: Yes. This scent in the wind, much like that night, signifies warning.\n{Flashback scene}\n{Wan Ye running}\nPursuer: Stop!\n{Wan Ye halts}\nWan Ye: (resigned sigh), Just one step away from the rendezvous port, and yet you still found me.\nPursuer: By the Sword Hunt Decree, hand over your swords.\nWan Ye: If you could make an exception for me, it might go smoother.\n{Wan Ye pivots}{Pause for 1s}\nPursuer: (astonished) Maple leaf?\n{Wan Ye draws his sword}\nPursuer: (cries out) Ahh! {Two voices here to indicate multiple pursuers}\n{End of flashback}\nWan Ye: Let\u0026rsquo;s lower the sails, Sister Leader; it\u0026rsquo;s time to brace for the storm.\n[Sound of a large ship moving]\nAct V Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Strategist, Rogue\n[Thunderclap][Ship anchors]\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, since you initiated this, you handle the liaison with the Resistance Army.\nWan Ye: Alright. Sister Leader, take a stroll around the harbor and wait for my message.\n{Wan Ye departs}\n{Sister Leader wanders around}\nSister Leader: Huh? There\u0026rsquo;s actually a poem written on this bulletin board: \u0026ldquo;This body is like autumn leaves adrift across mountains and seas.\u0026rdquo; Ha!\n{Sister Leader writes on the bulletin board}\nSister Leader: We\u0026rsquo;re back! Kid, write another poem!\nPasserby: Hey, this is a bulletin board, not a message board.\nSister Leader: Hahaha. [Voice fades out]\n{Wan Ye sits by the riverbank waiting for the Strategist}\nWan Ye: Clouds disperse above high skies, revealing the reflection of home in the sunset glow. Mm, [flourish of his sleeve] the last line.\n{An arrow whizzes by; Wan Ye dodges, arrow lands in water}\nWan Ye: Honestly, I already lack poetic talent, and then to be interrupted like this.\n{Wan Ye advances, his sword moves like a shadow, swiftly resolving the situation}\nWan Ye: Oh, I got it now. The last line is, \u0026ldquo;A wanderer\u0026rsquo;s heart drifts.\u0026rdquo;\n{Strategist applauds}\nStrategist: Wan Ye, you remain as sharp as ever. No wonder you escaped from the general\u0026rsquo;s grasp; looks like our Resistance Army will gain a formidable warrior.\nWan Ye: Strategist, you know why I\u0026rsquo;ve come. Our Resistance Army gains more than just a warrior.\nStrategist: What are your conditions?\nWan Ye: Sister Leader\u0026rsquo;s goal is simple: money and entertainment. As for me, I merely hope to advise the general, to share our way of the samurai.\nStrategist: That royal court duel\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I hold no grudge against the general. The winner gains an opportunity, the loser faces divine punishment – that\u0026rsquo;s the rule. But our voices should be heard by the general.\nStrategist: Our views align unexpectedly; we do not intend to provoke civil war. In the face of foreign threats, unity is paramount. However, the general\u0026rsquo;s decisions have left many samurais disillusioned. We assembled into an army not to rebel, but to impose order and reduce chaos. Since the general no longer accepts royal court duels, we can only\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I understand what Strategist intends. You hope to break through the heavily guarded imperial residence to directly advise the general.\nStrategist: Exactly. Currently, our samurai forces are evenly matched with the military. We need an unforeseen force to influence the battle. Moreover, according to reliable intelligence, the general will personally lead the troops soon, and we can use this opportunity to show our resolve to her.\nWan Ye: Resolve\u0026hellip; I doubt the general would merely listen based on that alone. For us samurai, what is the original intention behind wielding our swords\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nAct VI Characters: Wan Ye, The General, Sister Leader, Strategist, Samurai, Soldiers\nScene: Battlefield\n[Rendered battlefield][Thunderstorm sounds]\n(Samurai forces are retreating)\nSoldier A: The General is indeed extraordinary; upon her arrival on the battlefield, she commands like a deity, driving the Resistance Army into continuous retreat.\nSoldier B: Indeed, with her here, it seems this turmoil is finally coming to an end!\nGeneral: Advance! Give the Resistance the final blow.\n(Soldiers charge)\nStrategist: Finally, my hidden soldiers.\n(Pirates join the fray)\nWan Ye: You\u0026rsquo;re quite patient, Strategist.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader charge)\nSister Leader: I hope you can afford the price of hiring us, rebels.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader are about to confront the General)\nSoldier A: Not good, hurry and protect the General!\nSoldier B: We can\u0026rsquo;t extricate ourselves right now!\nSister Leader: General, let me behold your supreme martial skills.\nGeneral: Hmph, those who attempt to shatter eternity, show me your resolve.\n(The General unsheathes her sword and slashes forward)\n(Sister Leader retreats)\n(The General strikes again) [Thunderclap]\n(Flashback) Friend: There are always earthly creatures bold enough to face the might of thunderbolts.\n(Wan Ye steps forward)\nWan Ye: Sister Leader!\n(Wan Ye blocks the General\u0026rsquo;s strike)\nWan Ye: (with effort)\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: What expression would he have in that final moment?\nWan Ye: (gathers strength)\n(Wan Ye pushes the General\u0026rsquo;s sword away)\nGeneral: (startled inhale)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: That same expression once more.\n(The General slashes again, pushing Wan Ye back)\n(Wan Ye struggles to rise)\nWan Ye: (groans in pain)\n(Soldiers surround them)\nSoldier: General!\nGeneral: Stand aside for now.\n(Soldiers retreat, the General approaches Wan Ye)\nGeneral: I remember you. The day a samurai challenged me in a royal court duel, I exacted punishment, and you, stole his sword. I marked you as a top priority target, yet you managed to elude capture.\nWan Ye: Never meant to offend the General; there were extenuating circumstances.\nGeneral: Your friend has fallen beneath my blade. And you, having witnessed the outcome of defiance firsthand, why persist on this path?\nWan Ye: General, it\u0026rsquo;s not just me who\u0026rsquo;s resolute. Most likely, we merely wish to safeguard our swords, our desires.\nGeneral: Desires? Has the ancient samurai spirit not been lost, leaving only empty shells of swordsmanship techniques? In this chaotic era, isn\u0026rsquo;t a samurai wielding a sword only adding to the confusion? As a samurai from a noble house yourself, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you understand whether the true essence of the samurai code still exists within your family\u0026rsquo;s teachings, let alone wandering samurais who might not comprehend the ethics they should adhere to?\nWan Ye: The General has a point; the samurai code is barely discernible in my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings anymore. Through my travels and sparring with various samurais, I too have failed to find it.\nGeneral: Given this\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: Yet my dear friend, even in his vulnerability, sought opportunities for samurais. Despite the hardships, he chose to appeal alone. And the samurais, though begrudgingly, avoid unnecessary conflict and unite despite their differences.\nGeneral: So this is your perspective. What do you think samurai aspire to achieve with their swords?\nWan Ye: I believe it\u0026rsquo;s the unwavering commitment to and propagation of the samurai ethos. Each samurai household possesses its unique traditions, hence the vast and complex samurai community. Every martial art needs its own lineage, and among them, swordsmanship is something that must never be forsaken, which is why the samurai react against the Sword Hunt Decree.\nGeneral: Even so, the scattered factions of samurai, each adhering to their distinct ways of swordsmanship, present an inherently unstable element, conflicting with the eternal peace I strive for.\nWan Ye: However, if utilized properly, the power of the samurai can also serve to protect eternity. Earlier, my friend asked me,\nWan Ye \u0026amp; Friend: If one day our land is ravaged by disaster, and the people are no longer under the protection of the gods,\nFriend: What would you choose to do?\nWan Ye: When our land is beset by disaster, a samurai would unhesitatingly uphold the moral principles they cherish. Upholding benevolence, righteousness, propriety, sincerity, honor, loyalty, and bravery - samurai pursue benevolence, thus even in defiance, they ensure not to harm the innocent populace; they pursue righteousness and propriety, therefore even in rebellion, they establish alliances openly and honorably; they strive for loyalty and bravery, thus never harboring intentions to usurp power. Samurais do not disdain the world, nor do they incite chaos; they wield not weapons of slaughter, but swords that breathe life into the samurai spirit, ultimately guarding the samurai way. The samurai spirit is not lost; rather, it lies dormant in the peaceful passage of generations, ready to awaken as an unparalleled force when called upon.\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: In this conflict, am I the only one escalating it?\nWan Ye: General, why do you pursue eternity?\nGeneral: (deep breath) My sister once promised eternity to her subjects, where time flows but nothing changes. Yet, she who promised eternity could not sustain it herself, sacrificing her life in the previous anti-invasion war, exchanging it for the peace that prevails until today. Taking her place as the ruler, I inherit her promise; as the highest and most revered figure, I must offer my people a dream, named Eternity. (pause) Do you feel the bitter pain every time you grasp your sword? Though the power of swords and blades can crush countless enemies and overcome numerous challenges, there are things that cannot be cleaved by swords, even she, who protected her people with her sword, was but a fleeting dream, vanishing suddenly.\nWan Ye: There is no escaping pain. Dreams may be ephemeral, but they possess the brightest colors. Humans are not immortal, yet they possess boundless potential. Disasters lurk everywhere, sacrifices occur at any moment, but those who sacrifice themselves illuminate the entire sky with their burning passion, while those who continue to carry dreams will keep forging ahead, protecting our land.\nGeneral: Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re right; the conflict should not continue. (sighs) Policy changes require careful consideration. For now, maintain the unity of the samurai league. (loudly) Withdraw the troops!\n(The General departs)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: Although her physical existence may vanish like a dream, she has transformed into the divine cherry blossom in our hearts, and perhaps that is also a form of eternity.
