Origin and Evolution: Phase One: Biological Metaphor Phase. Richard Dawkins first introduced the concept of \u0026ldquo;meme\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;The Selfish Gene,\u0026rdquo; suggesting that information is transmitted through continual replication, with the basic unit facilitating this process being the replicator. Memes are replicators with the ability to copy themselves in the cultural evolutionary process. Memes primarily rely on self-replication and dissemination of content and form for propagation, leading to unpredictable cultural mutations.\nPhase Two: Cultural Theory Phase. Belgian scholar Héleène further developed meme theory, proposing that the lifecycle of memes includes stages such as assimilation, memory, expression, and transmission. In essence, after individuals receive and comprehend the content of memes, these memes are stored in the human brain. During the stage of information expression, individuals exhibit two attitudes towards memes: acceptance, leading to active editing and creation of new memes, and rejection, ensuring that old memes remain in individuals\u0026rsquo; minds, creating lasting memories. As individuals engage with meme culture, creating new memes and spreading them, memes infect new individuals, restarting this lifecycle.\nPhase Three: Internet Memes. Generally, digital content such as text, images, videos, etc., spread rapidly and widely on the internet, falls under the category of internet memes. Huffman views internet memes as \u0026ldquo;popular cultural units spread, imitated, and transformed by internet users, also created and shared by internet users.\u0026rdquo; Coleman defines internet memes as \u0026ldquo;infectious images, videos, and catchphrases that rapidly spread on the internet through continuous imitation and modification by users.\u0026rdquo; These definitions underscore that internet memes inherently exhibit significant variability, surpassing the realm of mere self-replication. The massive and atomized active participation of users is a crucial indicator of how internet memes come into being. Any internet user can become an anonymous creator of internet memes.\nInternet Meme: Specifically Refers to Memes Disseminated Through the Internet as a Medium Definition: These are infectious images, videos, and catchphrases rapidly spreading on the internet through continuous active imitation and modification by a large number of users. Source: Initial meme texts originate from platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, online live streaming, etc., excerpted from events or non-events. Form: After mutation, the structural forms vary widely, especially in GIFs, short videos; diverse grammatical structures, with statements and exclamations each accounting for 50%, leading to significant dissemination effects. Textual Features: Manifestation of subjectivity, projecting subjectivity through self-expression and expressions towards others, e.g., \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, but I am greatly impressed,\u0026rdquo; originating from director Ang Lee\u0026rsquo;s comment on the documentary \u0026ldquo;Bergman Island,\u0026rdquo; expressing his perplexity and astonishment at the documentary; \u0026ldquo;Shuan Q\u0026rdquo; reflects the subject\u0026rsquo;s speechless and mocking emotions towards the object. Cat Meme: The subject of study here pertains to video-based cat memes Definition: These are infectious videos featuring cats as creative material, rapidly spreading on the internet through continuous active imitation and modification. Uniqueness: Recently, these have gained popularity online, leading to a plethora of second creation videos, resulting in a distinctive phenomenon of dissemination. Example: 是不是你和女朋友旅游现状#猫meme的日常 #猫咪表情包 #恋爱日常 #Le - 抖音\n00后勇闯奇瑞汽车 编导岗区区涨一万粉丝嘛 年轻人会帮助年轻人的对吧00后整顿职场#猫meme - 抖音\n最恐怖的一集 #猫meme #猫咪 #人间真实 #生活 - 抖音\nMotivation for Research/Choice of Topic The use of emojis has become a popular means of online communication among internet users, especially among university students. Recently, there has been a surge in the production of cat memes on the internet, leading to a trend of creating short videos based on these cat memes. The prevalence of these cat meme-based videos as a youth subculture phenomenon revolving around internet symbols holds significant research value.\nInnovation:\nWhile the academic community has established a foundation in the study of emoji dissemination, with clear and in-depth research on their usage, dissemination phenomena, and interaction patterns, there is a lack of research on the use of emojis in the production of derivative videos. The factors influencing the participation of young people in the production or viewing of these derivative videos have not been adequately addressed. Therefore, this study focuses on the interactive behaviors and dissemination phenomena of young users in narrative derivative content, analyzing the motivations of this group.\nFeasibility:\nYoung people are the primary participants in the production of such derivative content.\n(If narrowed down to university students—proximity)\nResearch Questions Attention is needed on the characteristics and current status of derivative content: What narrative elements are present in cat meme derivative videos (such as plot design, character development, emotional construction)? How do cat meme derivative videos reflect characteristics of youth subculture? In what ways do the emoji symbols and language styles in cat meme derivative videos manifest? In empirical research, the following questions are to be explored: Starting from the perspective of dissemination effects and motivations:\nWhat motivates young people to engage in the production of cat meme derivative videos? How do these motivations relate to their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values? What are the dissemination effects of cat meme derivative videos? Which factors (such as innovativeness, emotional resonance, social engagement) influence the willingness of young people to watch and share them? Are there group differences in the viewing and creation of cat meme derivative videos among young people? How do factors like gender, age, and educational background affect their participation? Starting from influencing factors and mechanisms:\nHow do the characteristics of social networking platforms (such as algorithmic recommendations, interactive mechanisms) influence the popularity and dissemination of cat meme derivative videos? How do the narrative structure and content innovation of cat meme derivative videos promote or restrict their dissemination and acceptance among young people? How do viewing and creation behaviors of cat meme derivative videos form specific chains of interactive rituals within the young community, and how does this ritual promote cultural identity and group cohesion? Research Purpose and Significance Research Purpose Through quantitative research, to determine the willingness and motivations of young people to participate in cat meme derivative videos, thereby clarifying the dissemination effects of these videos among young people and potential influencing factors; through qualitative research, from the perspective of youth subculture, to further explore the rapid spread and popularization of cat memes as a new youth subcultural symbol, aiming to delve deeper into the connection between this innovative narrative mode and elements such as youth values, identity, and emotional appeals.\nResearch Significance:\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s society of rapid development in information technology and mobile internet technology, visual culture forms centered around images and videos have become the primary means through which people perceive and understand the world. Young people are faithful producers, consumers, and disseminators of visual culture, and visual culture, with its rich visuality and virtual reality pleasures, is loved by young people and significantly influences them. The spiritual core and value concepts carried by visual culture affect the value orientation and judgment of young people, serving as a force in shaping their values.\nThe emergence of cat meme derivative videos as a favored new visual cultural form among young people warrants study, not only for capturing real-time trends and filling certain practical gaps in youth subculture research academically, but also for making societal contributions by aiding in a better understanding of the cultural and psychological needs of young people, creating spaces of mutual respect, and leaving room for the next wave of innovative developments in youth subculture, thus possessing both research value and necessity.\nResearch Design (Research Methods and Content) Content Analysis Method Corresponding to the research questions:\nWhat narrative elements are present in cat meme remix videos (such as plot design, character development, emotional construction)? How do cat meme remix videos reflect characteristics of youth subculture? How do the emoticons and language style in cat meme remix videos manifest? Utilizing the content analysis method to analyze cat meme videos on the Bilibili platform. Sampling videos with the cat meme tag as the overall sampling frame, a certain number of cat meme videos will be selected based on their publication time. After obtaining the videos, they will be coded according to narrative elements, subcultural characteristics, emoticons, and language style as different categories, and the data will be processed.\nInterview Method Corresponding to the research questions:\nWhat motivates young people to participate in the production of cat meme remix videos? How do these motivations relate to their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values? Are there group differences in watching and creating cat meme remix videos among young people? How do factors such as gender, age, and educational background influence their participation? How does the narrative structure and content innovation of cat meme remix videos promote or limit their spread and acceptance among young people? Initially, through in-depth interviews, understanding the personal and social motivations of young people participating in the production of cat meme remix videos, including their social identity, emotional needs, and cultural values. Additionally, conducting focus group discussions on the differences in watching and creating cat meme videos among young groups of different genders, ages, and educational backgrounds, to comprehend the social and cultural factors behind these differences. Simultaneously, discussing how the narrative and innovative content of cat meme remix videos influence the acceptance and dissemination among young people, especially how these factors affect the popularity and acceptance of the videos.\nTheoretical Framework Interaction Ritual Chains Theory: Proposed by the American sociologist Randall Collins, the Interaction Ritual Chains Theory posits that the study starts with situations, encounters composed of individuals, and micro-situations interlinked to form macro patterns. The network linking local situations is termed an \u0026ldquo;interaction ritual chain.\u0026rdquo; The components of an interaction ritual include: (1) two or more people gathered in the same place, (2) boundaries set for outsiders so participants know who is included and excluded, (3) attention focused on a common object or activity with mutual communication of this focus, and (4) sharing of common emotions or affective experiences. The acquisition of emotional energy is a key reason for individuals engaging in interaction rituals, a core element of interaction ritual chains. Both the creation and viewing of cat meme emoticon remix videos by young groups participate in the interaction ritual of this cultural symbol, craving identity affirmation and emotional resonance from others. Carnival Theory: The fundamental aspects of Bakhtin\u0026rsquo;s Carnival Theory can be summarized by three key terms: carnival, carnivalesque, and carnivalization. Carnival is a folk festival celebration, serving as the starting point and support for carnival theory, with values including the subversion of hierarchies and advocating equal dialogue. The carnivalesque is a symbolic code derived from cultural forms and meanings, categorized into four realms: (1) intimate contact allowed during the carnival, (2) playful banter as a mode of interaction, (3) an attitude of equal intimacy in life, and (4) vulgarity, representing a democratized lifestyle. Possessing characteristics of universality, ritualism, equality, and subversion, carnivalization originates from the carnival itself, with its artistic expression in literature and art termed carnivalization, eliminating any exclusivity and mutual disdain. As a multi-element, multimodal discourse, the meme as a language, with its strong narrative and visual appeal, has become the most favored form of expression among young people, embodying the universal characteristics of carnival, satisfying the public\u0026rsquo;s need for self-expression and political engagement. Dramaturgical Theory: Goffman\u0026rsquo;s Dramaturgical Theory posits that social interactions resemble theatrical performances, where individuals play various roles in daily life and present themselves in different ways. In this theory, the well-known concepts of frontstage and backstage are pivotal. The frontstage is the aspect intentionally displayed to others, while the backstage is where suppressed aspects reside, hidden from the audience\u0026rsquo;s view. Manipulating the frontstage and backstage constitutes \u0026ldquo;impression management.\u0026rdquo; Young groups utilize cat meme emoticons to narrate video content, presenting their \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; selves on the frontstage, while their undisclosed selves remain concealed in the backstage. For both the sender and receiver, the use of memes is not just an expression but also a performance, aiding individuals in shaping their ideal selves more effectively.

Integrating a Qt Designer-built interface with the Python programming language and leveraging the powerful ffmpeg tool, users can effortlessly specify video files, set cut points, and execute video processing tasks. The ultimate goal is to enhance video editing efficiency, particularly catering to users who require batch video processing.\nBrief Workflow Outline: Environment Setup Install necessary software and libraries: Ensure Python environment is properly configured, install PySide6, and ffmpeg.\nInterface Design (Using Qt Designer) Main Interface Design Design includes buttons for file selection (to choose video files), input fields for time trimming (for intro and outro removal times or direct cropping period), output path selection button, preview window (optional), start processing button, and progress bar. Convert the .ui file into .py.\nWriting Core Logic Code Read Video Information: Use ffmpeg to fetch video duration and other basic information. Time Processing: Based on user inputs, compute actual trimming command parameters (primarily end time). Invoke ffmpeg: Construct and execute ffmpeg command-line instructions for video slicing and joining. Progress Feedback: Implement logic to update progress bars, showcasing video processing advancement (may involve parsing ffmpeg output). Error Handling: Catch and handle errors during ffmpeg execution, providing user-friendly alerts. Binding Interface with Logic Code Utilize PySide\u0026rsquo;s signals and slots mechanism to connect interface elements (e.g., button click events) to backend processing logic.\nTesting \u0026amp; Debugging Thoroughly test the software for accurate video trimming and concatenation, responsive UI, and effective error handling mechanisms.\nOptimization \u0026amp; Aesthetics Adjust layout based on test feedback for an improved user experience; consider incorporating multithreading to enhance program responsiveness, especially when dealing with large files.\nPackaging \u0026amp; Deployment Package the application into an executable file (using tools like PyInstaller) for easy distribution and deployment, ensuring it runs smoothly on systems without a development environment.\nInterface Design Employ Qt Designer for interface design, including creating UI elements, layout adjustments, and setting component properties.\npyside6-uic input.ui -o output.py\rFrom main.py import ui from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication\rfrom output import Ui_MainWindow # 假设转换后生成的文件名为output.py\rclass MainWindow(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):\rdef __init__(self):\rsuper().__init__()\rself.setupUi(self) # 初始化界面\r# 进一步设置信号槽和其他逻辑...\rif \u0026quot;__name__\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;:\rapp = QApplication(sys.argv)\rwindow = MainWindow()\rwindow.show()\rapp.exec_()\rCore Logic Code Implementation Setting FFmpeg Path (in config.py) import os\rclass ffpath:\r# 相对路径\rffmpeg_path_relative = '.\\\\FFmpeg\\\\bin\\\\ffmpeg.exe'\rffprobe_path_relative = '.\\\\FFmpeg\\\\bin\\\\ffprobe.exe'\r# 转换为绝对路径\rffmpeg_path = os.path.abspath(ffmpeg_path_relative)\rffprobe_path = os.path.abspath(ffprobe_path_relative)\rInitializing FFmpeg (in ffmpegApi.py) import subprocess\rimport os\r#import time\r# 从config.py中拿到ffmpeg.exe和ffprobe.exe的绝对路径\rfrom config import ffpath\rclass FFmpeg:\r# 初始化函数，用于初始化实例的ffmpeg_path属性\rdef __init__(self, ffmpeg_path):\rself.ffmpeg_path = ffmpeg_path\rDefining run Method to Invoke cmd (in ffmpegApi.py) While subprocess.Popen accepts a list, due to potential spaces and paths in FFmpeg commands that could lead to errors, we input as a string for reliability.\n# 定义run方法来执行FFmpeg命令\rdef run(self, cmd):\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\r执行给定的FFmpeg命令，并返回其输出。\r参数:\r- cmd: 一个列表，包含要执行的FFmpeg命令及其参数。\r返回值:\r- 执行命令的标准输出（字符串）。\r抛出:\r- Exception: 如果命令执行失败（返回码非0），则抛出包含错误信息的异常。\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rcmd = [self.ffmpeg_path] + cmd\rcmd_str = ' '.join(cmd)\rprint(f\u0026quot;尝试执行：{cmd_str}\u0026quot;)\rp = subprocess.Popen(cmd_str, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\rout, err = p.communicate()\rif p.returncode != 0:\rprint(f\u0026quot;命令执行失败，错误信息：{err.decode('utf-8')}\u0026quot;)\rraise Exception(err.decode('utf-8'))\rVideo Trimming (in ffmpegApi.py) definition of extract_video function:\ndef extract_video(self, input_folder, start_time, end, output_folder, encoder='-c:v copy -c:a copy'):\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\r获得FFmpeg命令的逻辑，给出具体的FFmpeg命令并传入run函数中运行\r参数：\rfolder：输入输出文件夹参数须为绝对路径字符串\rstart_time, end：片头片尾的持续时间参数须为H:mm:ss:fff格式的字符串\rencoder参数须为字符串，默认为'-c:v copy -c:a copy'复制流\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rUnder extract_video, define time_calculate to handle tail durations, given FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s inherent start-to-end trimming approach, requiring timestamp calculation based on the specified outro duration.\ndef time_calculate(duration, end):\r# 转换为浮点数进行计算\rhours, minutes, seconds_milliseconds = end.split(':')\rseconds, milliseconds = seconds_milliseconds.split('.')\rhours = float(hours)\rminutes = float(minutes)\rend_float = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + float(seconds)\rend_float += float(milliseconds) / 1000\rend_time_float = duration - end_float\rprint(\u0026quot;结束时间点为：\u0026quot;, end_time_float)\r# 浮点数结果转换为字符串格式\rm, s = divmod(end_time_float, 60)\rh, m = divmod(m, 60)\rend_time = \u0026quot;%02d:%02d:%06.3f\u0026quot; % (h, m, s)\rprint(\u0026quot;结束时间点为：\u0026quot;, end_time)\rreturn end_time\rCore in the extract_video function is using -accurate_seek, which, while not perfectly accurate, avoids errors, suitable for bulk operations.

We aim to identify the concrete manifestations of such inequalities within the particular community, encompassing aspects such as the distribution of infrastructure, allocation of public service facilities, and usage patterns of residential public spaces.\nResearch Background Social Space Social space is a central concept in urban sociology, profoundly developed and elucidated by French scholars such as Bourdieu and Lefebvre. Distinct from other concepts like social structure, social systems, and social networks, social space focuses on actors, their positions, and the relationships between them. It underscores the structural nature of social space and maintains close ties with Marxist theory.\nUrban ecology perspectives offer a different understanding of social space, seeing it as the setting where social interaction occurs, emphasizing the influence of social structures on individual behavior. Simmel views social space as having cohesiveness, conscious boundaries, and stresses the internal relations within space; for him, social distance transcends physical proximity, incorporating emotional dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Goffman further investigates how individuals organize their surrounding space through his work Behavior in public places: notes on the social organization of gatherings.①\nIn summary, social space is a complex and multi-dimensional concept that encompasses individuals, locations, interactions, and power dynamics. Diverse schools of thought and scholars interpret social space differently, providing rich perspectives for understanding urban social life.\nStudies on Social Space Previous studies have approached social space in various ways:\nThe multifaceted research paths on social space: Different scholars have proposed numerous research avenues, including community-based spatial sociology, situational spatial sociology, distributive spatial sociology, and productive spatial sociology. This diversity reflects the varied interests in different aspects and dimensions of social space.② The practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of space play pivotal roles across these diverse research paths.③\nTransformation and dilemmas of public space: Research on public space emphasizes its evolution and the challenges it faces. Public space has conceptual, social, and material attributes in social life. In the conduit society model, urban public spaces are categorized into regulatory and nodal types, serving as critical domains for power and capital regulation.④ Although public space loses its integrative functions over time and tends toward specialization in modern society, it retains the potential to connect disparate groups and carries real social space significance despite being shaped by power and capital dynamics.\nSocial space in the Chinese context: Within the Chinese context, social space research covers economic, political, and social changes in urban spaces. Institutional transformation, economic restructuring, and social structure changes jointly shape the evolution of urban spaces. This includes shifts in the role of urban governments, economically-driven spatial restructuring, and the balancing of commercial and civic values. Studies on urban space also highlight homogenization and instability, pointing to the socioeconomic dynamics in spatial transformations.⑤\nExploring these three research paths provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in social space research, contributing to the construction of a richer and more profound theoretical framework for social space.\nAfter a deep comprehension of social space theories and their research trajectories, we adopt an integrated research perspective. Social space is both a macroscopic view of actors, their positions, and structural relations between them, and a microscopic view of individual social interaction contexts.\nDrawing upon proximity and accessibility, we select Dingfuzhuang community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, for in-depth inquiry. Focusing on the unequal distribution and use of social space among different regions, neighborhoods, or specific sites, we aim to understand the concrete manifestations of these inequalities within the local community, such as the distribution of public service spaces, the use of residential public spaces, and the planning and development of industrial spaces. Not only concentrating on the practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of social space, but also considering the specific social and economic structures within the Chinese context, our goal is to accurately analyze the impact of social space inequality on residents\u0026rsquo; lives and social interactions.\nResearch Methods and Findings Literature Review Providing an Overview Spatial Concentration: From the perspectives of both Chaoyang District and Dingfuzhuang, public service spaces, residential public spaces, and industrial spaces all exhibit characteristics of concentration. This concentration phenomenon may lead to certain communities or areas enjoying a greater abundance of resources and services, while other regions relatively lack these amenities. Such unequal distribution of resources could potentially give rise to social inequality issues, impacting residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions.\nGreen Spaces in Suburbs: Similarly, green spaces are also concentrated in suburban locations with limited accessibility, which hinders their use by residents. The centralized distribution of suburban green spaces might result in some residents having difficulty accessing natural environments conveniently, thereby influencing their quality of life and social engagement.\nHorizontal Expansion, Vertical Decline: Dingfuzhuang is situated along the horizontal axis of Beijing, and within the urban planning of Chaoyang District, it is incorporated into the CBD-Dingfuzhuang Media and Cultural Industry Belt. This horizontal development axis has given rise to a pattern where social space in Dingfuzhuang experiences robust horizontal expansion but relative vertical decline. In this context, the horizontal dimension primarily represents the growth of industries and work flow, whereas the vertical dimension symbolizes human life trajectories and movement patterns. The emphasis on the horizontal aspect reflects, to a certain extent, the underemphasis on human-centric livability factors within this area.\nThus, we proceeded with field research and questionnaire surveys to delve deeper into the underlying situations and causes.\nField Research Reveals Nuanced Details Site Selection: In our field research, we focused extensively on areas found in the literature review to have high concentrations of public service spaces. Ultimately, we selected two representative residential communities, namely Dahuangzhuang Nanli and Dingfu Home, as well as the DREAM2049 International Cultural and Creative Industry Park and the Wando Technology \u0026amp; Culture Industry Park for in-depth investigation.\nAbsence of Youth in Public Spaces? Research Log: During the evening at the cultural square, young people seemed conspicuously absent; instead, seniors were predominantly engaged in activities such as playing cards, chess, and even using ping-pong tables for card games despite the heavy snow from the previous day. Fitness facilities remained largely unused. Strikingly, the crowd was mostly male, with only a few women interspersed among groups of men. One elderly couple was seen accompanying two children, with no other children present. The open space at Dahuangzhuang Nanli\u0026rsquo;s cultural square, closely connected to nearby residential neighborhoods, revealed a notable absence of young people, particularly those from the adjacent Communication University-affiliated secondary school. The commercial offerings in Jinyinbao Life further suggested that the place caters mainly to an older demographic. This asymmetry between proximity to youth congregation points and their lack of presence here prompted us to investigate this phenomenon further.\nOversized Residential Areas with Overconcentrated Commercial Spaces Research Log: Dingfu Estate, built near a subway station, inevitably exhibits Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)-related issues, most notably the clustering of commercial areas around the subway entrances. With its large scale, residents living far from the subway stations might find it challenging to fully access the related conveniences. Dingfu Home covers a vast area, and ground-level shops are densely distributed near subway exits or shared intersections, often leaving residents with just one or two shopping districts within walking distance, easily missed if they take the wrong route.\nCompared to Dahuangzhuang Nanli, Dingfu Home is newer and hosts more renters and young people. We observed that the residential estates here are enormous yet poorly interconnected. Consequently, social connections among residents in Dingfu Home are sparse. Furthermore, the overconcentration of businesses around the subway stations affects residents\u0026rsquo; ability to enjoy the full benefits of nearby commercial zones.\nSevere Imbalance in Road Traffic Pressure Research Log: Walking northwards through Dingfu Home South and then North, I noted that during the morning rush hour at around 9 am, the traffic on Chaoyang Road was bustling and noisy. However, upon diverting onto any perpendicular (north-south, or longitudinal) road, one would be surprised by the wide and sparsely occupied four-lane roads (such as Sanjianfang Middle Road). It raises the question of why such broad roads exist when the traffic demand seems lower.\nThe difference in traffic volume between longitudinal and transverse roads in the vicinity of Dingfu Home is striking. While transverse roads are packed with vehicles during peak hours, longitudinal roads are eerily quiet with only a few cars passing leisurely. This disparity highlights another issue: the government\u0026rsquo;s attention to transverse road construction seems to overshadow maintenance and improvement of longitudinal roads. This neglect leads to rampant illegal parking, piled-up snow along the roadside, and cyclists forced to navigate close to the center of these roads—a worrying situation for the \u0026rsquo;last mile\u0026rsquo; connectivity to homes. This imbalance calls into question whether the infrastructure truly prioritizes people\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nNotable \u0026ldquo;Tidal Ghost Town\u0026rdquo; Phenomenon Inside Industrial Parks Research Log: The overall impression of the industrial parks was that they felt desolate and unkempt, akin to a construction site hastily converted into a park with a few buildings erected. The parks had minimal landscaping, featuring merely a sparse line of pine trees every several meters. There were no outdoor recreational areas provided for employees within the parks, such as for sports, rest, or dining. The nearest park required a walk of over 40 minutes, rendering it practically inaccessible during working hours. The construction of parks seemed to prioritize residential areas, while the developers of the industrial parks failed to invest adequately in greening efforts. The employee experience, mental and physical health, and the provision of comfortable working environments appear to have been overlooked by society.\nThroughout Chaoyang District, numerous cultural and creative industry parks occupy significant urban space. Yet, these parks, which serve as new locales for Beijing\u0026rsquo;s cultural industry growth, suffer from a pronounced \u0026ldquo;tidal ghost town\u0026rdquo; phenomenon. Specifically, after sunset and as workers leave for home, these parks become deserted and inactive, with expansive squares left unused. As these parks take up considerable urban land, the question arises whether there are more rational strategies for spatial utilization that can ensure round-the-clock functionality and vibrancy.\nEmpirical Research Measuring Resident Perceptions Building upon the observations and details discovered in our field research, we further conducted empirical research utilizing questionnaires and in-depth interviews to gauge residents\u0026rsquo; actual perceptions. We distributed questionnaires to college students in Beijing, collecting 101 valid responses and three sets of in-depth interview materials. Additionally, we administered questionnaires to general Beijing residents, obtaining 524 valid responses. We will explore the resident perceptions reflected in the questionnaires through descriptive statistics.\nYoung People Are Not Absent, But Misaligned Our questionnaire data revealed that young people indeed frequent parks and malls. However, why are they scarcely seen in our observations at Dahuangzhuang Nanli? The reality is that residential public spaces and industrial zones often do not align with the preferences of younger demographics. An interviewee pointed out, \u0026ldquo;It feels like the nearby parks are for seniors; they don\u0026rsquo;t suit us.\u0026rdquo; This indicates that young people are not absent from the social space in Dingfuzhuang; rather, they are misaligned with the older population. While different groups having varied preferences is normal, our concern lies in the fact that across the three surveyed locations, covering a substantial area, various public spaces catering to diverse populations are not evenly distributed. This observation substantiates the conclusion regarding spatial concentration, highlighting an aspect requiring attention during urban planning.\nStrong Resident Perception of Social Space We note that social spaces, as interactive venues, are strongly perceived among residents. Parks and commercial plazas are frequently visited spaces, and notably, the subway system emerges as a frequented scene, reflecting alongside the deficiency in longitudinal transportation lines in Dingfuzhuang, an imbalance in the development of horizontal and vertical space flows in residents\u0026rsquo; lives.\nSummary This paper analyzes the current state of social space in Dingfuzhuang, Chaoyang District, Beijing, from a theoretical perspective of social space, uncovering issues such as uneven distribution of public service spaces, oversized residential areas coupled with overly concentrated commercial facilities, extreme and imbalanced traffic pressures, and the \u0026ldquo;tide-empty city\u0026rdquo; phenomenon within industrial parks. These problems not only affect residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions but also reflect irrationalities and unsustainability in urban planning and development.\nTo improve the social space in Dingfuzhuang and enhance its livability and vitality, we propose the following recommendations:\nIncrease the supply and distribution of public service spaces, especially within residential areas and surrounding industrial parks, providing more parks, libraries, museums, sports venues, etc., catering to the needs of residents across age groups and interests, fostering community cohesion and accumulation of social capital.\nAdjust the scale and structure of residential areas, reducing enclosed compounds and increasing open blocks to strengthen inter-residential connectivity and interaction, improving convenience and safety for residents\u0026rsquo; travel, and creating more humanistic and diversified living environments.\nBalance traffic pressure and distribution, optimizing the design and management of both horizontal and vertical roads, enhancing road usage efficiency and safety, promoting public transport and non-motorized vehicle use, reducing private car usage and parking, decreasing traffic congestion and pollution, and elevating the city\u0026rsquo;s greenness and aesthetic appeal.\nActivate the internal space utilization of industrial parks, adding greenery and leisure spaces within them, offering more cultural and creative activities to attract more young people and entrepreneurs, creating vibrant and innovative industrial parks, facilitating industrial transformation and upgrading, and strengthening the city\u0026rsquo;s competitiveness and influence.\nThrough these recommendations, we aim to bring about improvements and development to the social space in Dingfuzhuang, ultimately creating a better future for both its residents and the city itself.\nReferences 社会空间从齐美尔到戈夫曼，刘思达，2023 迈向什么样的空间社会学——城市社会学对象的四种路径与反思，营立成，2019 空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究，宗海勇，2018 秩序、利润与日常生活——公共空间生产及其困境，杨宇振，2018 社会空间和社会变迁——转型期城市研究的“社会—空间”转向，钟晓华，2013 View the document (CN)\n","date":"2023-12-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/img5_hu30ed1aa73e227ae6d498d3fb11922757_176292_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/","title":"【Academic Research】Social Spatial Inequality within The Dingfuzhuang Community"},{"content":"Application Scenarios Online Course Editing:\nLegacy Courses: Batch update of intros and outros across varied formats (encoding, resolution, frame rate, audio format).

It is capable of handling tasks such as encoding, decoding, format conversion, editing, merging, extracting, compressing, decompressing, filtering, and subtitle handling for multimedia files. Compatible with various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.\nFFmpeg GUI Applications\nFortunately, we\u0026rsquo;re not confined to solely using command lines with FFmpeg anymore, as there are now several open-source graphical user interface (GUI) alternatives. Here are some noteworthy ones:\nLosslessCut\nSource Code: https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut Specifically designed for video trimming without batch processing capabilities. Allows marking multiple segments within a video and exporting them losslessly and swiftly. QuickCut\nSource Code: https://gitee.com/haujet/QuickCut Offers features like video compression, transcoding, reversing, concatenating clips, cutting based on subtitles, auto-subtitling, and automated editing. Not optimized for batch processing. Format Factory\nNote: Not open-source, and it\u0026rsquo;s advised not to download the latest version due to unwanted background activities. However, older versions remain functional. FFmpeg Batch AV Converter\nSource Code: https://github.com/eibol/ffmpeg_batch Enables batch trimming of video beginnings and endings based on duration, along with adding intro and outro sequences, although batch trimming might encounter issues. Batch Processing of Intros and Outros After testing numerous FFmpeg GUIs, many were found lacking in functionality, customization, or reliability, leaving no entirely satisfactory off-the-shelf software solution. Given FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s command-line nature, however, batch processing can be achieved through scripting. Here are some pre-existing scripts and resources:\n[Bat File + FFmpeg] Batch Video Splitting, Format Conversion, and Merging Requires no additional runtime libraries. Link to the video tutorial. [Windows] Batch Removal of Video Intros and Outros (FFmpeg + Shell Script) Requires installing the Git Bash tool. Original Post. Implementing Large Video Segmentation, Watermarking, and Intro/Outro Merging Using FFMPEG + Python Requires installing Python. Article Link. Ultimately, opting for the simplest approach led to choosing the Bat File + FFmpeg script solution. By referencing online resources and leveraging AI-generated code assistance, a tailored script was developed to fulfill the requirements.\nVideo Trimming Workflow Challenges in video trimming stem from FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s lack of reverse search capability, necessitating total video duration calculation for endpoint determination. Despite being straightforward, numerous GUIs falter when batch processing non-standard online course videos, potentially due to dynamic frame rates, audio inconsistencies, or GUI implementation issues, leading to errors or output videos with missing segments and audio-video sync problems. Ultimately, custom scripts proved most reliable for comprehensive video compatibility.\n@echo off\u0026amp;title MP4 批量掐头去尾（运行版）\rsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\recho 该脚本可以批量将目录内MP4文件，从头尾裁减固定时间。（如将多个视频，开头剪3s，结尾剪5s）\recho 如需批量指定视频的开始结束时间，请打开另一个脚本。（如指定多个视频，都从1分12秒开始，到5分27秒结束）\recho 如果您是从其他地方获取的该脚本，请先看一下b站视频，有详细介绍，谢谢。https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ic411N7ny/\recho 该脚本基于ffmpeg，请确保您已将ffmpeg添加到环境。\recho 时间作差部分依靠 @随风 @https://pokes.blog.csdn.net/\recho 获取视频文件时长借鉴 @亦良Cool @https://blog.csdn.net/annita2019/article/details/128747458\recho 作者虎啸ROAR b站：https://space.bilibili.com/19075528 个人网站：https://www.luotianyi.blue\rrem 提示用户输入开头裁剪的时间，或者跳过\recho 若当前选项为0，可直接按回车\rset /p sh=请输入开头切割的 小时部分（如开头无需切割，输入-1）:\rif \u0026quot;%sh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; goto zs if not \u0026quot;%sh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; goto os\r:zs\rset st=00:00:00.00\recho 开头裁剪时长 %st%\rgoto end\rexit\r:os\rrem 用户输入小时、分钟、秒和毫秒，设置开头裁剪时间\rset sh=00\rset /p sm=请输入开头切割的 分钟部分:\rif \u0026quot;%sm%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set sm=00\rset /p ss=请输入开头切割的 秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%ss%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set ss=00\rset /p sms=请输入开头切割的 毫秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%sms%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set sms=00\rset st=%sh%:%sm%:%ss%.%sms%\recho 开头裁剪时长 %st%\rgoto end\rexit\r:end\rrem 提示用户输入结尾裁剪的时间，或者跳过\rset /p eh=请输入结尾切割的 小时部分（如结尾无需切割，输入-1）:\rif \u0026quot;%eh%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; ( goto ze) else ( goto oe)\rexit\r:ze\rset et=00:00:00.00\recho 结尾裁剪时长 %et%\rgoto fin\rexit\r:oe\rrem 用户输入小时、分钟、秒和毫秒，设置结尾裁剪时间\rset eh=00\rset /p em=请输入开头切割的 分钟部分:\rif \u0026quot;%em%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set em=00\rset /p es=请输入开头切割的 秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%es%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set es=00\rset /p ems=请输入开头切割的 毫秒部分:\rif \u0026quot;%ems%\u0026quot; == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; set ems=00\rset et=%eh%:%em%:%es%.%ems%\recho 结尾裁剪时长 %et%\rgoto fin\rexit\r:fin\rrem set st=0\rrem set et=00:00:02.80 rem 创建结果目录\rcd /d %~dp0\rmd result\rrem 对每个MP4文件进行裁剪\rfor /f \u0026quot;delims=\u0026quot; %%i in ('dir /b /s /a-d *.mp4') do (\rrem 获取视频持续时间\rfor /f \u0026quot;tokens=2 delims=, \u0026quot; %%a in ('ffmpeg -i \u0026quot;%%i\u0026quot; 2^\u0026gt;^\u0026amp;1 ^| find \u0026quot;Duration:\u0026quot;') do (\rset str=%%a\r)\rrem 设置裁剪结束时间为输入的结束时间\rset time=%et%:!str!\rset t=!time!\rcall :time0 \u0026quot;!t!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;!time!\u0026quot; ok\recho 本视频开始时间为 %st% 结束时间为：!ok!\rrem 执行裁剪操作\rffmpeg -ss %st% -to !ok! -accurate_seek -i \u0026quot;%%~si\u0026quot; -c:v copy -c:a copy \u0026quot;result\\%%~ni.mp4\u0026quot;\r)\rpause\rrem 将输入的时间转换为ffmpeg可识别的格式\r:time0 @echo off\u0026amp;setlocal\u0026amp;set /a n=0\rfor /f \u0026quot;tokens=1-8 delims=.: \u0026quot; %%a in (\u0026quot;%~1:%~2\u0026quot;) do (\rset /a n+=10%%a%%100*360000+10%%b%%100*6000+10%%c%%100*100+10%%d%%100\rset /a n-=10%%e%%100*360000+10%%f%%100*6000+10%%g%%100*100+10%%h%%100)\rset /a s=n/360000,n=n%%360000,f=n/6000,n=n%%6000,m=n/100,n=n%%100\rset \u0026quot;ok=%s%:%f%:%m%.%n%\u0026quot;\rendlocal\u0026amp;set %~3=%ok:-=%\rVideo Concatenation Workflow Video concatenation is easier theoretically, yet available references were scarce. As a programming novice, I utilized GPT-assisted learning to devise a failsafe concatenation strategy. FFmpeg offers two concatenation methods: direct concatenation for MPEG via concat protocol and universal concat demuxer, both supporting lossless and re-encoding. Testing revealed unpredictable outcomes when merging differently formatted videos.\nThe solution involved employing FFmpeg\u0026rsquo;s filter_complex for re-encoding (lossy), preceded by uniform encoding settings adjustment to ensure consistency. This, while time-consuming, guaranteed reliability. Uniformity across frame rate, resolution, aspect ratio (ensuring 1:1 to avoid mismatches), audio sample rate, and channel count was crucial.\nrem 此为核心内容\rfor %a in (\u0026quot;*.mp4\u0026quot;) do\rffmpeg -i \u0026quot;.\\input\\op.mp4\u0026quot; -i %a -i .\\output\\ed.mp4\u0026quot; -filter_complex \u0026quot;[0:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v0];[1:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v1];[2:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v2];[0:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a0];[1:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a1];[2:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a2];[v0][a0][v1][a1][v2][a2]concat=n=3:v=1:a=1[vout][aout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[vout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[aout]\u0026quot; -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -ac 2 \u0026quot;!output_file!\u0026quot;\rrem 此为封装使用的文件源码\r@echo off\rsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\rrem 设置输入文件夹和输出文件夹路径\rset input_folder=input\rset output_folder=output\rrem 检查输出文件夹是否存在，如果不存在则创建\rif not exist !output_folder! mkdir !output_folder!\rrem 遍历当前目录的所有mp4文件\rfor %%a in (*.mp4) do (\rset input_file=%%a\rset output_file=!output_folder!\\%%~na.mp4\rrem 使用FFmpeg进行连接，调整编码参数\rffmpeg -i \u0026quot;!input_folder!\\op.mp4\u0026quot; -i \u0026quot;!input_file!\u0026quot; -i \u0026quot;!input_folder!\\ed.mp4\u0026quot; -filter_complex \u0026quot;[0:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v0];[1:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v1];[2:v]fps=30,scale=1280:720,setsar=1[v2];[0:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a0];[1:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a1];[2:a]aformat=sample_rates=44100:channel_layouts=stereo[a2];[v0][a0][v1][a1][v2][a2]concat=n=3:v=1:a=1[vout][aout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[vout]\u0026quot; -map \u0026quot;[aout]\u0026quot; -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 44100 -ac 2 \u0026quot;!output_file!\u0026quot;\recho !output_file! created.\r)\recho All files processed.\rendlocal\rrem 这个命令的解释如下：\rrem 这个FFmpeg命令是用来合并视频文件的。具体来说，它首先会在当前目录下查找所有的mp4文件（使用通配符\u0026quot;*.mp4\u0026quot;来匹配），然后针对每一个文件执行以下操作：\rrem 执行ffmpeg命令，将当前目录下的op.mp4（在input目录下）作为第一个输入文件，将当前遍历到的mp4文件作为第二个输入文件，将当前目录下的ed.mp4（在input目录下）作为第三个输入文件。\r使用-filter_complex进行过滤操作。三个文件分别表示为[0:0], [0:1]；[1:0], [1:1]；[2:0], [2:1]，然后使用concat过滤器将它们拼接起来。n=3表示有三个输入流，v=1表示合并视频流，a=1表示合并音频流，合并后的视频流和音频流分别为[v]和[a]。\rrem 使用-map选项将拼接后的视频流和音频流分别映射到输出文件中。\rrem 设置视频编码器为libx264，使用预设，设置视频码率为800000，帧率为30。\rrem 设置音频编码器为aac，音频码率为192k，音频采样率为44100，声道数为2。\rrem 将合并后的视频和频流输出至output目录下，输出的文件名与原文件相同但扩展名为.mp4。\rRe-encoding parameters were tailored to specific needs.\n-c:v h264_nvenc -preset fast -b:v 800000 -r 30 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy\r-c:v h264_qsv -global_quality:v 22\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 256k\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 800000 -r 30 -c:a aac -b:a 256k\r-c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 800000 -vf \u0026quot;scale=1280:-1\u0026quot; -c:a copy\rHandling Silent Segments Application Scenario: Removing pauses, waits, or stutters from long videos.\nImplementation Principle: Audio amplitude detection identifies silent parts, with XML export for further review, restoration, or edits.\nSolution 1: Automated Editing Tool A mature software product, iteratively refined for comprehensive functionality.\nSolution 2: FFmpeg Silence Detection\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=0.5 -vn -sn -dn -f null /dev/null\r# -af with silencedetect measures volume levels; compatible with specific audio formats.\r# noise sets the quiet threshold (default -60dB); d defines silence duration (default 2 seconds).\r# -vn, -sn, -dn ignore non-audio streams for efficiency.\r# On Windows, replace /dev/null with NUL.\r# For multi-channel audio, specify per-channel detection: ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af \u0026quot;silencedetect=mono=1\u0026quot;\r# For multi-channel audio, it is possible to specify detection for each channel individually.\rffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af \u0026quot;silencedetect=mono=1\u0026quot; -vn -sn -dn -f null /dev/null\rRapid Slicing \u0026amp; Inspection Details are omitted, but key points include:\nTranscribed text serves primarily for timestamp reference.

Indeed, the term \u0026ldquo;city,\u0026rdquo; employed to delineate vast human settlements geographically, inherently encompasses a pivotal variant of public space—the market, a locus dedicated to commercial transactions.\nFrom the Spring and Autumn Period to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the evolution of ancient Chinese cities traversed a phase dominated by enclosed markets, epitomized notably by the East and West Markets of the Tang Dynasty, embodying traditional agrarian-commercial policies and control over the mercantile class. Subsequent to the mid-Northern Song Dynasty, enclosed markets gradually yielded to street markets, heralding an era of openness and vibrancy in urban life, signifying the emergence of a civic stratum in ancient Chinese urban societies. Commercial venues evolved into the central hub and paramount public spaces of civic life, a characteristic still resonant in contemporary Chinese urban landscapes.\nFurthermore, spaces for resident interaction and communication proliferated. Temple fairs, originating from temples, evolved into distinctive cultural events during the Song Dynasty, continuing to furnish avenues of entertainment for citizens to this day. The guildhalls of the Ming and Qing periods, structured akin to familial compounds, transcended regional confines to serve as novel public spaces. In the realm of cultural and recreational pursuits, open streets and alleys provided new venues for folk artistic performances, giving rise to established venues for performances such as the \u0026ldquo;wazi.\u0026rdquo; Gardens, functioning as public spaces, proffered scenic and tranquil settings for leisurely strolls and recreational activities. Notably distinct from Western cities where squares hold prominence, the core of ancient Chinese cities lay in palaces or governmental offices, spaces seldom accessible to the public. In summation, ancient urban public spaces manifested characteristics of dispersed derivation, commerce and entertainment centrality, introverted small-scale nature, and secular essence.\nWhile modern-day assembly activities in China primarily unfold on urban streets, public spaces conducive to civic political life remained scarce in cities. However, post-1949, this landscape underwent a profound transformation. With the establishment of the People\u0026rsquo;s Republic of China, Beijing as the capital saw the prioritization of political public space development. Following renovation and expansion, Tiananmen Square emerged as a historically significant urban plaza, serving not only as a public space for Beijing but also as a national public arena.\nPresently, across Chinese urban landscapes spanning from metropolises to small townships, a plethora of public spaces like commercial streets, urban squares, parking lots, green parks, and sports fields continue to burgeon. This metamorphosis mirrors the rapid economic growth and accelerated urbanization in China. The rise in per capita disposable income has elevated the living standards of the majority of urban residents, transitioning from mere sustenance to affluence, from mere sustenance to leisure, with every urban square in China showcasing this progress. For instance, square dancing has become the quintessential activity emblematic of contemporary Chinese urban public spaces, vividly showcasing the kaleidoscope of activities within these spaces. The diverse activities within urban public spaces are shaping the core values of the nation, displaying its prosperity, multiculturalism, and contemporary visage. As potent instruments for showcasing national image and culture, urban public spaces hold immense research value.\nLiterature Review Study of Urban Public Spaces From Social Space to Urban Public Space Throughout the past century since the rise of sociology in the 19th century, sociologists\u0026rsquo; conceptualization of space has been continuous. The notion of space, through profound discussions by French social thinkers, gradually extended towards the more abstract category of \u0026ldquo;social space.\u0026rdquo; Whether it be Bourdieu\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;field\u0026rdquo; or Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;production of space,\u0026rdquo; they all argue that social space, in contrast to other concepts such as social structure, social systems, and social networks, focuses on the actors, locations, and their relationships. It emphasizes the structural nature of social space, influenced by Marxist theory.\nThe theories of social space by Simmel, the first generation of the Chicago School, and Goffman present different understandings of social space, viewing it as the setting for social interactions and emphasizing the influence of social structure on individual behavior. Simmel posits that social space possesses cohesion, conscious boundaries, and underscores internal relationships within space. In his theory, social distance entails not only physical proximity but also emotional dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Goffman, through \u0026ldquo;Relations in Public,\u0026rdquo; further investigates how individuals organize the spaces around them.\nUrban public space, as a specific form of social space, emerged in the 1960s in the United States during a period of acute urban issues, gradually gaining acceptance through the advocacy for citizen rights maintenance by planners like Jane Jacobs. By the 1970s, the concept of urban \u0026ldquo;public space\u0026rdquo; took shape, becoming a platform for urban issues and the built environment\u0026rsquo;s exploration of social relations in cities. Defined in Li Dehua\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Principles of Urban Planning,\u0026rdquo; urban public space is described as outdoor spaces for the daily and social use of urban residents, encompassing streets, squares, outdoor spaces in residential areas, parks, sports facilities, and more. Moreover, the book suggests that the broad concept of urban public space can extend to spaces for public facilities, such as city centers, commercial areas, and urban green spaces. This definition of public space is essentially synonymous with outdoor spaces.\nWhether in the production-oriented spatial sociology or the situational spatial sociology, the focus has often been on studying space directly, with little attention given to the activities of individuals within that space. Yingli Cheng et al. (2019) propose a preliminary concept of \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; spatial sociology, reinterpreting the production and situational aspects of space from the perspective of space participants. This proposition offers a new approach to studying \u0026ldquo;individuals.\u0026rdquo; Urban public space similarly follows this research direction, with a focus on the ontology, attributes, characteristics, and determinations of public space, while often neglecting the study of residents who use urban public spaces. In recent years, scholars have delved into the perception and supply mechanisms of residents, with Liu Ru et al. (2022) considering residents\u0026rsquo; perceptions as a factor in measuring spatial justice, exploring solutions to optimize spatial justice starting from residents\u0026rsquo; attitudes, thus filling the gap of micro-quantitative research in spatial studies. Sang Jin et al. (2023) propose that in addition to the government\u0026rsquo;s direct supply of public spaces, a \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; supply mechanism involving stages of \u0026ldquo;value discovery—individual action—government response—institutional evolution\u0026rdquo; is needed. In this mechanism, the public is studied as a supply entity, serving as a supplement to the study of residents in urban public spaces.\nPublic Space and Art The concept of public art originated in the United States in the 1960s and was first introduced in China in the 1990s. Early understandings of public art primarily viewed it from an artistic perspective, considering it as a form of art used for beautifying the environment and decorating spaces.\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, research on public art in China has undergone a significant \u0026ldquo;social turn.\u0026rdquo; Yang Wenhui (2004) focuses on the development of modern Chinese cities and the evolutionary history of public space art, emphasizing the organic integration of public space with the natural environment. Zhou Chenglu (2005), from a sociological perspective, interprets the public nature of art, noting that the power dynamics within \u0026ldquo;public space\u0026rdquo; are of great public concern. Zou Feng (2005) argues that the development of the Chinese economy and society has led public art to shift from defining traditional elite forms that represent national values towards a direction that caters to the aesthetic preferences of the public, maintaining a strong social aspect throughout its development.\nSun Zhenhua (2009) further advances the core concepts of public art, including the pursuit of publicness, the transformation of sociology, and the specificity of regions and places. He believes that the planning of public space must be supported by social research to fully understand the impact of art on the public. This \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; reflects the economic and social development in China, integrating the public more deeply into the study of public spaces.\nPublic Spaces and Communication The discussion on urban image and mass communication has a long history. However, the study of communication in urban public spaces has gradually emerged alongside the \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; of public art in China, displaying a certain synchronicity. Therefore, the research on communication in urban public spaces also considers visual expression as a significant subject of study. Zhao Junxiang (2015) explored the design of museum public spaces within the context of visual communication, proposing a unified perspective on visual communication, visual aesthetics, and visual order. Lin Yuancheng et al. (2021) found through empirical research that promotional outdoor advertisements create emotional spaces through visual representation, enriching spatial governance.\nWith the development of intelligent visual technology and digital communication technology, research on communication in urban public spaces has shifted towards the mediatization of these spaces. Su Zhuang (2012) and Chen Lin (2016) conducted studies on public screens and museums, highlighting the role of public spaces as mediums for information dissemination and cultural display, which hold significant importance in the construction and identification of cities. Yan Ya (2017) proposed that \u0026ldquo;urban spaces are constructed as \u0026lsquo;scenes\u0026rsquo; through their connection with the body, where the body is observed within the \u0026lsquo;scene\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; The youth express a desire to engage with urban spaces, deconstructing traditional \u0026ldquo;center-periphery\u0026rdquo; urban structures within mediatized urban spaces. Pan Ji (2017) suggested, from a geographical media perspective, that media technologies link spatial elements and cultural histories according to the logic of different cities, blending media with urban life to continuously create new urban spatiotemporal interactions. Tang Yunbing (2020) summarized the development of urban public spaces as artistic objects, public domains, and communication mediums in fields such as communication and art studies, examining urban public spaces from a visual communication perspective where the visual representation system is continually practiced in public domains.\nMoreover, some scholars have begun to focus on the impact of technology on the formation of the urban public space landscape in the context of societal spectacle. Li Jiayi (2013) proposed an interesting viewpoint in their research: \u0026ldquo;The development of consumer culture, entertainment culture, visual culture, and new media is propelling our society towards a spectacle society, where the cultural landscape of cities, as a hallmark of the times and urban culture, is being reconstructed along with social transformation.\u0026rdquo; This perspective underscores the close interplay between technology, culture, and social transformation.\nHowever, current research on urban public spaces as communication content and the object of urban public spaces remains relatively limited. Yu Shuang et al. (2017) pointed out in their research that \u0026ldquo;urban images reflect the spatial reality of urban existence, constructing a mediatized imaginative space,\u0026rdquo; viewing images as carriers of urban content while emphasizing the importance of constructing a \u0026ldquo;communicative city\u0026rdquo; as a new path for interactive and dialogic interpersonal communication. While these studies offer insights into the relationship between urban public spaces and communication, further in-depth research and follow-up in this field are urgently needed.\nThere are certain gaps in the overall research on communication in urban public spaces. This data chart highlights the relatively fewer directions of current research, indicating untapped potential and opportunities in this field. Future research can delve deeper into understanding the complex relationship between urban public spaces and communication, especially focusing on the objects of communication and their needs and attitudes towards urban public spaces, to advance the development of this field.\nUrban Public Spaces and National Image National image is the impression and evaluation formed in the international community and among domestic populations of a specific country based on its history, current situation, national behaviors, and activities.\nUrbanization has been one of the themes accelerating China\u0026rsquo;s modernization process since the 21st century. However, Chinese urban images face the dilemma of being homogenized. At the same time, in the current new historical period, the rising China urgently needs to shape and communicate a national image as a major power. The linkage between urban image and public spaces has become a research focus for some scholars. Zheng Chenyu (2016) proposed that on the basis of the musical and internet carrying capacities of national image that he introduced, \u0026ldquo;urban image is an important carrier of national image carrying capacity, and virtual shaping of urban image is a crucial and malleable part of national image carrying,\u0026rdquo; further presenting four paradigms of transition from urban image shaping to national image construction: \u0026ldquo;knowing the autumn from a single leaf\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;a hundred flowers in full bloom,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;self-improvement without pause\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;moral integrity and bearing.\u0026rdquo; Xiao Xiao (2020), based on the context of the new media era, emphasized that the new media era provides favorable conditions for the interaction between national and urban images, advocating for creating urban images that align with the national image and utilizing the power of new media to disseminate urban images to a broader audience. Tan Zhen (2021) believes that urban image and national image are interdependent and mutually influential, exploring four functional dimensions of urban image in national image construction, including concrete functions, emotional functions, experiential functions, and identity functions.\nWhile specific research on the relationship between urban public spaces and national image has received less attention in the past, it has recently gained significance. Tang Yunbing (2020) analyzed the national image on urban public spaces from a visual communication perspective, suggesting that urban public spaces, through visual elements like sculptures, art, and advertisements, serve as crucial platforms for constructing national image. These elements not only showcase regional cultures but also, through mass media dissemination, shape the core values of the nation, displaying its prosperity, multiculturalism, and modern face. This construction of visual image is not only an expression of national identity but also a means of international communication and cultural output. Furthermore, from the stages of art, media to intelligent development, public spaces witness the modernization process of cities and nations through various forms of visual image construction, serving as potent tools to showcase national image and culture on the international stage.\nFurther exploration in this research field will help us better understand the role of cities in the construction of national image, providing more effective pathways to shape a positive national image. In the current new historical period, China\u0026rsquo;s rise makes this research particularly crucial, offering new models for the interactive relationship between global urban images and national images. Research focusing on the relationship between urban public spaces and national image is expected to provide a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of national image construction and dissemination, contributing new perspectives and directions to the diverse development and international communication of Chinese urban images.\nIn conclusion, past research on urban public spaces mainly focused on exploring the attributes of spaces themselves while relatively neglecting the study of the participants in these spaces—the \u0026ldquo;people.\u0026rdquo; This is evident in the insufficient research on urban public spaces as communication content and the objects of urban public spaces in the study of urban public spaces and communication. Particularly in the context of the relationship between urban public spaces and national image, research is still in its early stages and requires more attention to the aspect of communication objects. Therefore, our research will focus on the communication objects in urban public spaces, emphasizing their roles as participants and receivers of information in urban public spaces to deeply analyze the impact of urban public spaces on the construction of national image, providing new perspectives for a more comprehensive and effective construction of national image.\nResearch Methods Desk research—literature analysis\nEmpirical research—combining qualitative and quantitative approaches\nTheoretical Framework Utilization and Fulfillment The theory of utilization and fulfillment focuses on the goals and satisfaction individuals seek when choosing and using media. This theory emphasizes the audience\u0026rsquo;s agency in relation to media, highlighting their purposeful and conscious selection and utilization of media to attain specific psychological and social satisfaction. In urban settings, the design of public spaces directly shapes the scenes in which individuals choose and interact. By creating engaging environments, urban design guides audiences to seek leisure, social, and cultural experiences within spaces. Diversified urban public space designs cater to the needs of various demographics, fostering community cohesion and cultural diversity. Such designs present a livable, culturally rich urban image, thereby cultivating a positive national identity.\nWe will utilize this theory to explore how to create urban public spaces that better satisfy the audience.\nSites of Memory The theory of sites of memory, conceptualized by the sociologist Pierre Nora in \u0026ldquo;Realms of Memory,\u0026rdquo; refers to places that evoke collective memory, carrying historical and cultural significance, becoming symbols of shared memories. Integrating the theory of sites of memory into the design of urban public spaces entails creating locations that serve as carriers of collective memory. Through urban public space planning, we can establish places with historical heritage and cultural significance, using unique design elements and cultural symbols to evoke historical memories and cultural emotions, transforming them into shared scenes of perception and reminiscence. These places are not merely physical spaces but also bridges connecting the past, present, and future. Such designs not only reinforce the historical roots of a national image at the urban level but also enhance national cohesion through shared memory experiences.\nWe employ this theory to analyze urban social spaces with historical and cultural significance and explore the sustainable development of urban public space design.\nSpatial Sociology of \u0026ldquo;Utilization-Experience\u0026rdquo; The spatial sociology of \u0026ldquo;utilization-experience\u0026rdquo; is a theoretical concept proposed by Chinese scholar Ying Li Cheng, deriving from the influences of Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s production of space and Giddens\u0026rsquo; structuration theory on spatial research paths. Its core concept focuses on individuals\u0026rsquo; practical behaviors and perceptual experiences in space. This theoretical perspective shifts the focus from traditional spatial structures and forms to people\u0026rsquo;s actual usage and perception of space, emphasizing the practicality of space. Lefebvre emphasizes that space is a product of social practice, while \u0026ldquo;utilization-experience\u0026rdquo; theory highlights individuals\u0026rsquo; actual usage and perception of space. Giddens\u0026rsquo; structuration theory focuses on the impact of social structures on individual behavior, whereas the \u0026ldquo;utilization-experience\u0026rdquo; theory emphasizes individuals\u0026rsquo; subjective practices and experiences in space, introducing more subjective dimensions. Thus, the spatial sociology of \u0026ldquo;utilization-experience\u0026rdquo; encompasses three aspects of practical analysis: 1) individuals\u0026rsquo; perception, utilization, and interaction with space; 2) interest groups engaging in space governance based on their feelings and emotional investments in space; 3) individuals\u0026rsquo; communication activities in networked spaces and other usage behaviors.\nWe do not overlook the theoretical path formed by spatial practices and structuration theory, and we apply it to analyze the current state of urban public spaces. Additionally, we will employ the \u0026ldquo;utilization-experience\u0026rdquo; theory to analyze individuals\u0026rsquo; practices and experiences in urban public spaces, considering how urban public space design can encourage people to enjoy public spaces, participate in community building, and contribute to image cultivation.\nCase Study—Current State of Urban Public Spaces in China: A Case Study of Beijing As the capital of China, Beijing bears the functions of being the national political center, cultural center, international exchange center, and technological innovation center. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, following the grand blueprint outlined by General Secretary Xi Jinping to \u0026ldquo;adhere to and strengthen the core functions of the capital as the national political center, cultural center, international exchange center, and technological innovation center, thoroughly implement the strategies of creating a humanistic Beijing, a technological Beijing, and a green Beijing, and strive to build Beijing into an internationally first-class harmonious and livable capital,\u0026rdquo; Beijing has been undergoing profound transformation amidst the \u0026ldquo;additions and subtractions,\u0026rdquo; driving innovation leadership, endeavoring to effectively carry out tasks that benefit the people, and continuously enhancing the public\u0026rsquo;s sense of achievement, happiness, and security. On one hand, the unique nature of the capital gives it institutional and infrastructural advantages in international communication and external exchanges, carrying the responsibility of shaping the national image in the new era and enhancing China\u0026rsquo;s international influence; on the other hand, it bears the responsibility of improving the living environment of the people and building a livable city.\nTherefore, focusing on Beijing as the subject of study, this group combines theoretical analysis with empirical research to primarily investigate the following three questions:\n(1) What kind of urban public spaces does the country hope to build? (2) What kind of urban public spaces do the people wish to have? (3) The current status, strengths, weaknesses, and improvement measures of urban public spaces in relation to the dissemination of national image.\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, sociologists began to consider space as a distinct research object, asserting that there is no pure natural space in human society; all spaces are social in nature, giving rise to the theory of spatial sociology. Zong Haiyong (2018) examined various research paths in spatial sociology, highlighting the practical, social, human-centric, and historical aspects of space as crucial attributes for understanding space. Wu Xinyin (2023), in exploring the overall image construction and communication paths of rural public cultural spaces, categorized the development of public spaces into three types: protection, new construction, and renovation.\nThis analysis section aims to examine problem (1) from a macro perspective.\nProtection—The Case of Yuanmingyuan Yuanmingyuan, a key cultural heritage protection site in Beijing with historical significance, follows the international consensus of \u0026ldquo;restoring old as old\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;minimal intervention\u0026rdquo; in cultural heritage preservation, as stated by Chai Xiaoming, the director of the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage. \u0026ldquo;Restoring old as old\u0026rdquo; refers to maximizing the restoration of cultural heritage to its original state after repair, allowing it to authentically showcase its historical appearance. Cultural heritage preservation exemplified by Yuanmingyuan adheres to the principles of \u0026ldquo;restoring as old\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;minimal intervention,\u0026rdquo; emphasizing authentic preservation (including material, cultural, spiritual, and functional aspects) as seen in the partitioned display of Yuanmingyuan relics based on authenticity (Zhang Chengyu, Viewing the Functional Zoning Display of Yuanmingyuan Relics from the Perspective of Authenticity, 2010).\nIn her book \u0026ldquo;Memory\u0026rsquo;s Place,\u0026rdquo; Nora defines memory\u0026rsquo;s place as sites that evoke collective memory, bear historical and cultural significance, and become symbols of shared memories. Built during the Qing Dynasty, Yuanmingyuan has a history of over three hundred years, making it a significant memory\u0026rsquo;s place for the Chinese nation with a certain temporal and spatial significance. Despite being ravaged by invaders at the end of the Qing Dynasty and losing its original appearance, the protection of Yuanmingyuan relics demands the retention of signs of invasion even when technology could restore its original appearance. This is because it transforms Yuanmingyuan into not just a symbol of Chinese garden art but also a tangible symbol of the historical fact of Chinese national suffering under invasion, serving as an educational memory\u0026rsquo;s place with historical significance.\nAs a medium for transmitting the traumatic memories of eyewitnesses at that time, Yuanmingyuan relics have transformed these memories into a collective national trauma memory through the process of historical development, acquiring a communal quality of collective memory and insisting on completing the vertical transmission of memory across generations. Its temporal and spatial significance and collective memory endow it with the ability to be reconfigured as a reference framework for collective identity in today\u0026rsquo;s context. Therefore, Yuanmingyuan, as a cultural symbol of garden art itself and the national trauma memory it carries, has been integrated and elevated into a complete national symbol, becoming a symbol of national and cultural identity through the continuation of collective memory.\nThe ability of cultural memory to consolidate national identity lies in a group deriving from this knowledge storehouse a consciousness of our entirety and uniqueness, a definitive affirmation (who we are) or negation (who we are not). Collective memory serves as a crucial intermediary for constructing national identity and state identity. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasizes that national image internally concerns national identity, social cohesion, political order, and policy support. Therefore, public spaces of the protection type, as historical and cultural symbols, internally reinforce the identity of the Chinese nation, cultivate a sense of community consciousness and emotion, and complete the transmission route of \u0026ldquo;protected public spaces—collective memory—national identity—state identity—national image.\u0026rdquo; (Reflection: The research on the transmission from national identity to national image is lacking, and this transmission process currently remains at an abstract psychological theoretical level.)\nConstruction—Taking \u0026ldquo;The Box\u0026rdquo; as an Example \u0026ldquo;The Box\u0026rdquo; is formally known as the \u0026ldquo;outward-facing youth power center of The Box.\u0026rdquo; According to the Beijing Daily, the chief curator stated: \u0026ldquo;The CURETAIL solution proposed by URF redefines the relationship between \u0026lsquo;people, goods, and space\u0026rsquo; in a curatorial retail manner, defining a new commercial space. The space serves as a curated stage, where brands and products become part of the exhibition. Here, consumption is not merely transactional; retail is not just about selling goods. Transforming curation into a new force in retail, with characteristics of scenarization, gamification, curation, and self-media, provides consumers with a more immersive cultural consumption experience, allowing exhibitors to maximize the effects of flash changes, cross-border interactions, and storytelling.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Box\u0026rdquo; outward-facing is not a traditional shopping center but rather a showcase or stage.\nIn other words, since its inception, The Box has not only served commercial purposes but also carried the functions of cultural exchange and human communication. Zong Haiyong believes that the humanistic critique of space path \u0026ldquo;places people and their environment at the center, emphasizes the subjectivity of individuals in space, seeks to understand and discover the values and meanings influenced and limited by culture, consciousness, background, and other factors in places and daily life.\u0026rdquo;\nTherefore, we need to focus on the dual impact brought about by the appearance of The Box:\nFirstly, it provides a physical space for offline communication among young interest groups and serves as a stage for young people\u0026rsquo;s personal interests. The space itself offers a high degree of freedom, allowing participants to make certain changes, which are determined by individual free will. In a sense, this realization of human agency in space reflects the centrality of human beings. Thus, the human-centric nature of the space is exemplified in The Box.\nHowever, when considering the space\u0026rsquo;s impact on individuals, we must consider both users and observers: for young people who use this space extensively, The Box\u0026rsquo;s essence lies in commercialism, where \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo; is forced to serve as a means to promote consumption, masking the invasion of capitalism. Consumerist values will significantly influence and even alter the participants\u0026rsquo; thoughts. For those who do not directly use this space but are exposed to it, the culture formed by this youth interest group may further reinforce negative stereotypes of young people, leading to increased ideological conflicts and communication barriers between generations and individuals.\nTransformation—Taking 798 Art District as an Example Lefebvre emphasizes that the transition from one mode of production to another inevitably entails the emergence of a new space. The birth of the 798 Art District has a specific historical background, confirming a monumental shift in the mode of production in Beijing and even in Chinese society, making it a typical case of architectural transformation in Beijing.\nIn the 1950s, China realized the importance of building a modern industrial system, especially indigenous high-tech communication equipment factories, and with assistance from the Soviet Union, established the \u0026ldquo;State-Owned 718 Joint Factory\u0026rdquo; during the \u0026ldquo;First Five-Year Plan.\u0026rdquo; However, after 1985, due to factors such as resource depletion and environmental pollution, the global industrial development cycle entered a period of decline, and traditional industrial production faced transformation and elimination. The \u0026ldquo;birth pangs of the times\u0026rdquo; directly led to the 718 Joint Factory shifting from profit to loss, with a large number of workers being laid off and factory buildings lying idle. It was not until around 2002 that with the gradual leasing of the idle factory buildings to art groups, the area began its transition from \u0026ldquo;718 Joint Factory\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;798 Art District.\u0026rdquo;\nToday, the 798 Art District has become an important urban public space in Beijing. However, considering the transition from \u0026ldquo;Joint Factory\u0026rdquo; to art district, and the balance between \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;paid,\u0026rdquo; we must be concerned whether 798 has become an arena for the struggle between two ideologies.\nThe Popularization of Elite Aesthetics The process of transforming 798 from an abandoned factory to the largest and most influential contemporary art hub vividly illustrates that in the context of globalization and market conditions, grassroots forces are surpassing the early idealistic pursuit of \u0026ldquo;utopia.\u0026rdquo; They are integrating the pursuit of art with the current social and human living conditions, actively seeking their own discourse power. The concept and actions of its transformation, as well as the open and public nature in which 798 Art District is presented to the public, demonstrate great foresight and practicality.\nIn essence, before the emergence of art districts, art was predominantly monopolized by the elite upper class. The appearance of the 798 Art District has given contemporary art an educational function in public art, serving as a crucial bridge for the public to understand and engage with contemporary art. Contemporary art and its artists have transitioned from being \u0026ldquo;underground\u0026rdquo; to being in the public eye. Through the expansion of new functions in art districts and artists\u0026rsquo; villages, contemporary art has finally begun to integrate into public life, signifying the integration of art into people\u0026rsquo;s daily living spaces.\nThe Encroachment of Consumerism on Social Spaces However, the path to popularizing art in 798 is accompanied by the encroachment of consumerism and the establishment of a discourse hegemony system. On one hand, 798, as a symbol of \u0026ldquo;elegance\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bourgeoisie,\u0026rdquo; has shaped a group of people\u0026rsquo;s definition and self-perception of \u0026ldquo;art.\u0026rdquo; Regular visits to 798 have become a form of identity, predominantly for white-collar workers and those with a bourgeois inclination. People come here not just to shop but also to experience a certain emotion and cultural identity. Thus, art, like \u0026ldquo;fashion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;consumption,\u0026rdquo; has constructed a new social class where the ability to understand art and the level of art investment become significant determinants of individual social standing. On the other hand, 798 provides constantly evolving spaces for exhibitions, operas, ballets, and more. In many cases, the public is compelled to purchase the latest viewing rights and forsake what is deemed as outdated art forms. This depreciation of art forms is fertile ground for consumerism, where a \u0026ldquo;capitalist\u0026rdquo; form of transaction has taken root in 798.\nUsing 798 Art District as a reference point, what truly demands attention are broader societal issues: the problem of industrial structural reform. In 2013, China officially implemented the \u0026ldquo;National Plan for the Transformation and Adjustment of Old Industrial Bases,\u0026rdquo; which involved adjusting and reforming industrial bases formed during the \u0026ldquo;First Five-Year Plan,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Second Five-Year Plan,\u0026rdquo; and the development of \u0026ldquo;Third Front\u0026rdquo; regions, based on the layout and construction of state-owned heavy industry backbone enterprises. The planning period spans from 2013 to 2022. To this day, the transformation of all old industrial bases nationwide must be completed, signifying the partial transformation of communities holding collective memories of the heavy industrial era into urban public spaces, serving various functions such as citizen services, emerging industries, and commercial blocks.\nHowever, the transformation of the 798 Art District should serve as a warning signal for us. We need to contemplate whether industrial factory spaces born out of socialism can uphold their socialist essence in the present era. How can two ideologies achieve balance in the same space?\nCharacteristics of Planned Urban Public Spaces in China \\1. The application of digital technology has become a focal point.\nIn the era of big data, the rapid development of digital technology has brought new opportunities for the field of public spaces. Taking the preservation of the Old Summer Palace as an example, although the principle of authenticity in preservation requires that the restoration and protection of the Old Summer Palace cannot fully return to its pre-damaged state, relevant departments have utilized digital technology to complete the restoration of the Old Summer Palace. Visitors can experience the digital reconstruction of the Old Summer Palace through technologies such as 3D scanning and virtual reality.\n\\2. Trends in integrating urban social, ecological, and economic structures are evident in scenic gardens and old industrial sites.\nUsing Beihai Park as an example, the transformation of the once private garden into a public park has embodied the principles of ecological civilization, creating a city park that integrates ecological conservation, traditional culture, and garden art. In terms of integrating into society and citizens\u0026rsquo; lives, Beihai Park offers ice activities. As for old industrial sites, adhering to the principle of renovation without wasting land resources while preserving the historical significance of the industrial sites, focusing on ecological conservation as the core, restoration precedes transformation.\n\\3. Planning guided by a human-centric ethos\nEmpirical Research From the preceding analysis, we have gained a general understanding of the type of public spaces the country aims to construct. This empirical research primarily focuses on the following issues:\nIssue (2): What kind of urban public spaces do people hope to have?\nIssue (3): The current status, strengths, weaknesses, and improvement measures of urban public spaces in relation to national image dissemination.\nIn summary, the results of this empirical research successfully address Issue (3), presenting improvement suggestions from the perspective of the audience. It also reflects that for more public-oriented urban public spaces, people express higher satisfaction. However, in politically charged urban public spaces, especially those with a red theme, there exists a certain degree of deviation between people\u0026rsquo;s actual perceptions and the urban public spaces advocated by the state.\nQuantitative Research - Questionnaire Survey A total of 122 questionnaires regarding \u0026ldquo;Beijing university students\u0026rsquo; attitudes towards public spaces\u0026rdquo; were collected, with 21 invalid surveys excluded, resulting in 101 valid responses. Based on the questionnaire results, we can derive the following conclusions:\n(1) The main urban public spaces frequented by Beijing university students are commercial areas and city parks.\n(2) Students primarily seek entertainment and relaxation experiences in urban public spaces.\nConclusion (2) can be seen as the purpose and demand behind Conclusion (1). Due to students\u0026rsquo; inclination towards seeking entertainment experiences and emotional relaxation, they are more inclined to choose commercial areas and city parks when engaging with urban public spaces.\n(3) Convenience, comfort, aesthetics, uniqueness, and affordability are the primary reasons for students to choose public spaces.\nUrban public spaces, as a form of \u0026ldquo;implicit\u0026rdquo; communication content and medium, are essentially a process of media usage for students when engaging with them. Based on usage and satisfaction, students inevitably have their own purposes for selecting public spaces. By correlating Conclusion (1) and Conclusion (2) with the graphical information provided by the survey results, we can deduce that convenience, comfort, aesthetics, uniqueness, and affordability are the main reasons why students choose public spaces.\nTo explain this phenomenon, we can employ Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs theory.\nMaslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs can be categorized as physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, esteem needs, cognitive needs, aesthetic needs, self-actualization needs, and transcendence needs. Maslow posits that lower-level needs exert greater power and potential. As one moves up the hierarchy, the power of needs diminishes accordingly. Before higher-level needs can be met, lower-level needs must be satisfied (not necessarily to 100%). Thus, when selecting public spaces, consideration is also given to lower-order needs, such as practical aspects related to travel and expenditure. In the context of groups, the rapid economic and social development in contemporary China has largely fulfilled physiological and safety needs at the societal level, prompting a desire for satisfaction of higher-order needs. Particularly among the younger demographic represented by university students, the expression and satisfaction of self-worth, social and aesthetic needs gradually become their primary objectives for \u0026ldquo;external\u0026rdquo; activities. Commercial districts and natural parks in urban spaces precisely cater to participants\u0026rsquo; pursuit of individualized and aesthetic aspirations.\n（1）University students exhibit a strong willingness to communicate in public spaces. Whether through online group communication (the essential nature of the internet is the dissemination by a highly diverse collective of communicators, indicating the spontaneous gathering of a highly diverse network of communicators in cyberspace, engaging in communicative activities in a de-structured manner, transforming the originally non-standard social collective behavior into a standard form of communication in the internet realm, in other words, the evolution of dispersed societal behavior characteristic of the mass communication era into a normalized social aggregation within cyberspace) or interpersonal communication among friends, university students, overall, display a strong inclination for communication. However, their willingness to communicate in specific categories of urban public spaces varies slightly. When disseminating urban public spaces online, university students tend to prefer spaces that align with their own inclinations. Yet, in interpersonal communication, especially with individuals from different geographical locations, they are more inclined to choose public spaces that exhibit regional characteristics.\n（2）University students show little interest in \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; urban spaces. In terms of the willingness of university students to communicate in public spaces associated with \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; and patriotic education, which embody official ideological values, these spaces rank low in students\u0026rsquo; communication preferences. Nearly 70% of individuals would not bring friends to \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; spaces, and less than 2% would visit patriotic education spaces and engage in communication about them on the internet.\nOur analysis indicates two main reasons for this:\n① Psychological Avoidance Mechanism\nPublic spaces related to \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; and patriotic education tend to categorize items based on so-called \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;objective\u0026rdquo; principles, creating a strong sense of order that evokes solemn and reverential psychological responses in layout and visual presentation, establishing a tense and serious atmosphere.\nFurthermore, these urban public spaces in China often showcase historical memories that may include national traumas, such as revolutionary battles, the Korean War, and more recent events like the pandemic. Visiting such public spaces often entails a retrospective journey through history. During this historical reflection, visitors may experience feelings of melancholy, regret, and sadness. In more severe cases, individuals may suffer from vicarious psychological trauma. Vicarious psychological trauma refers to various psychological abnormalities indirectly caused by witnessing numerous brutal or destructive scenes that exceed the emotional and psychological tolerance limits of some individuals, leading to severe mental and emotional distress, even potential mental breakdowns (Liu Jun, Capital Medical University Affiliated Hospital).\nTherefore, individuals may be influenced by a psychological avoidance mechanism (wherein individuals may choose to avoid thinking about, evade, or escape emotions such as stress, threats, or sadness to alleviate discomfort) and refrain from selecting such public spaces for visitation and communication.\n② Self-Determination\nEdward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan jointly developed the Self-Determination Theory, which asserts that environmental conditions that satisfy individuals\u0026rsquo; basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness can enhance people\u0026rsquo;s initiative, creativity, and happiness.\nAutonomy: Individuals need to feel that their actions are self-chosen rather than imposed by external sources—the reasons for their actions exist within themselves rather than in external controls. The strong disciplinary and ideological significance of public spaces related to \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; and patriotic education places the audience in a passive position, particularly for young adults, such as university students, who highly prioritize personalized self-value realization and strongly reject public spaces that do not allow for a sense of autonomy.\nCompetence: Individuals must feel capable enough to engage in certain behaviors to achieve desired outcomes. Associated with intrinsic motivation is the spontaneous pleasure and sense of accomplishment that arises when individuals engage freely in goal-oriented activities. In a context filled with academic pressures, existential dilemmas, life stresses, and competitive pressures, young adults, represented by university students, are unable to choose public spaces that induce stress and oppression during their free time. Instead, they seek to alleviate pressure through their participation in public spaces.\nRelatedness: In experiencing competence and autonomy, individuals also need to feel connected to others. This need for relatedness, the desire to love and be loved, to care and be cared for, essentially a social need, can only be clearly felt through interpersonal interactions. Existing public spaces related to \u0026ldquo;red culture\u0026rdquo; and patriotic education offer a simple, cold, one-way flow of information, lacking the reciprocal participation of individuals and the exchange of information in a bidirectional manner.\nQualitative Research - In-depth Interviews Considering the feasibility of operation and the representativeness of the sample, this group systematically selected three university students at the Communication University of China for in-depth interviews. To safeguard the privacy of the interviewees, pseudonyms were used for all individuals interviewed.\nFollowing the extensive interviews, the general information of the interviewees can be summarized as follows:\nName Wang Chenxi Li Siyuan Zhang Mu Hometown/Current Residence Qingdao/Beijing Beijing/Beijing Beijing/Beijing Education Undergraduate Undergraduate Undergraduate Preferred Public Spaces Commercial districts, art districts, unique neighborhoods Landmarks, sports venues, museums Parks, squares, landmarks Communication Willingness Low Moderate Low Information Channels Xiaohongshu Xiaohongshu Xiaohongshu This group will analyze the results of this in-depth interview from the following three aspects.\nAudience Engagement What kind of public spaces do the public prefer? What experiences do they hope to encounter in public spaces? The outcomes of this question to a certain extent reflect the differences in cognition and perception between the \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; in public spaces, providing insights for attracting user engagement in public spaces. The findings of this in-depth investigation reveal that the public\u0026rsquo;s expectations for the content of public spaces are closely related to the categories of the spaces themselves. While public spaces exhibit common features in terms of infrastructure and architectural planning, the arrangement of activities and cultural characteristics are strongly influenced by individual interests, demonstrating a significant degree of heterogeneity.\nBased on the results of the in-depth investigation and questionnaire categorization, this group will elaborate on the results according to the categories of public spaces.\n(1) Commercial Districts and Art Zones\nDuring the in-depth interviews, we observed that when commercial districts take on the nature of urban public spaces, respondents often overlook their commercial features, reduce their purchasing behavior, and instead focus on the humanistic characteristics. In other words, respondents believe that commercial districts possess a cultural blend, where interactions and communications between tourists from different regions and locals allow them to experience the local customs and culture. Simultaneously, the presence of commercial districts can to some extent meet the social needs of respondents, with \u0026ldquo;being accompanied by friends\u0026rdquo; becoming a common practice in commercial districts.\nWang Chenxi: \u0026ldquo;Places like Nanluoguxiang, Drum Tower, and Shichahai are particularly enjoyable to stroll through. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly why they are so pleasant to visit, but when you walk through places like Citywalk, it can be quite intriguing, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t buy anything\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s lively and bustling, so you just go there and walk around. Each time, you follow the same route, starting from Nanluoguxiang, weaving your way to Drum Tower East Street, then circling around, eventually reaching Shichahai. That\u0026rsquo;s usually where you end up, and if you feel like it, you can take the subway to enjoy the view or go shopping.\u0026rdquo;\nZhang Mu: \u0026ldquo;Places like Nanluoguxiang are basically tourist attractions. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s part of a cluster of attractions, so many people say that when out-of-town visitors come, they usually visit\u0026hellip; I go there sometimes too, usually with friends, and then we casually stroll through Beihai Park.\u0026rdquo;\nThe high influx of visitors brings about a dual effect for commercial streets: on one hand, commercial streets have the potential to promote consumption while also serving as a platform for cultural exchange; on the other hand, authorities need to emphasize the character and cultural aspects of commercial districts to showcase regional uniqueness.\nRegarding art zones and art centers, respondents exhibited similar characteristics: they value the event content and economic expenditures. In terms of events, exhibitions that are novel, interesting, rare, and enriching in knowledge are more welcomed by respondents. Economically, respondents are willing to spend around 100-200 yuan on art exhibitions per visit.\nDue to the lack of professional aesthetic appreciation among most audiences, individual interests play a significant role in the selection of art categories, making it challenging to draw universal conclusions.\n(2) Landmarks and Iconic Buildings\nLandmarks and iconic buildings are public spaces commonly chosen by out-of-town and foreign tourists when exploring a city. Unlike commercial districts and art centers, landmarks and iconic buildings inherently possess stronger political significance, representing a microcosm of urban culture and characteristics. However, tourists tend to steer clear of political topics during their travels, making the cultural features and construction conditions of landmarks and iconic buildings their primary concerns.\nIn terms of infrastructure, respondents indicated that they are not particularly concerned about the construction of amenities like Wi-Fi, rest areas, or restrooms, considering them as \u0026ldquo;tolerable,\u0026rdquo; and instead place greater emphasis on the construction and maintenance of the landmarks themselves.\nLi Siyuan: \u0026ldquo;I believe that if historical buildings have been damaged due to historical factors, such as invasions or the Cultural Revolution, and are unable to undergo proper restoration, like in the case of the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan), where there are ruins, it still carries a beauty and allows you to sense a historical heritage in a way. However, I cannot accept it being used as a dumping ground or left partially restored, where you can clearly see traces of inconsistent repair work. I find it quite absurd, and I am even more unable to accept it being dirty and disorderly. Either plan properly or present it in its post-damaged state; don\u0026rsquo;t keep patching it up.\u0026rdquo;\nOverall, respondents hope that cultural landmarks can ensure beauty and cleanliness, or restrict access to areas that have undergone unified planning, have well-established tourist routes, and have adequate facilities, to ensure a comfortable and immersive experience for visitors.\nFor natural attractions, respondents noted that the main issue is the vast area of the scenic spots, making it challenging for individuals to explore everything in one go and demanding high physical endurance from visitors. Respondents expressed a desire for the promotion and availability of sightseeing vehicles in scenic areas to provide full-service assistance to visitors.\nRegarding cultural features, respondents believe that enhancing the regional characteristics of landmarks and iconic buildings, leveraging local culture to highlight the advantages of the scenic spots, and creating urban public spaces with uniqueness, historical significance, and memorability are essential to avoid architectural homogeneity.\nZhang Mu: \u0026ldquo;I think one thing that\u0026rsquo;s particularly unfavorable nowadays is when a city builds something like a clock tower or a sculpture, and then when you travel to another city, you see something similar, it becomes quite uninspiring. Each city\u0026rsquo;s architecture is unique and has its own distinctiveness; if every place has the same kind of structures, then it becomes unnecessary.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the perception of the public, the inclusiveness of urban public spaces such as squares, parks, and green areas has been further strengthened. These urban public spaces have completely shed political and cultural influences to become purely areas for public leisure activities.\nIn-depth interviews have revealed a familiarity and indifference towards squares, parks, and green areas among the interviewees. When asked about their views on small public spaces near their residences, interviewee Wang Chenxi expressed that small parks are \u0026ldquo;not very important\u0026rdquo; and their absence would not have an impact. Interviewee Li Siyuan described them as \u0026ldquo;generally planned,\u0026rdquo; while interviewee Zhang Mu mentioned they do not frequent such spaces much, usually only seeing elderly people dancing in the square.\nThis outcome to some extent indicates a noticeable generational difference in the use of urban public spaces. Squares, parks, and green areas belonging to residential areas have specific participant groups, primarily the elderly residents of nearby neighborhoods. Younger generations, on the other hand, show less concern for proximity and are willing to visit city public spaces further away for activities.\nDuring the in-depth interviews, interviewee Li Siyuan expressed a love for museums and non-profit exhibitions. Li Siyuan believes that exhibitions with a sense of history and the ability to reflect changes in specific historical periods and regions are more likely to pique visitors\u0026rsquo; interest. Li Siyuan also outlined several key features for constructing a museum that appeals to the audience:\n\u0026ldquo;Firstly, it should have permanent exhibitions reflecting the history of the city and the cultural development of a specific area. There should be several galleries that are always open, as well as rotating exhibitions showcasing different themes to keep visitors engaged. A museum must have spaces prepared for receiving and displaying these rotating exhibitions.\nFurthermore, in terms of lighting and spatial layout, it should be rational. The Chinese History Museum has a major issue where despite looking large from the outside, due to the design of stairs and elevators inside, the actual exhibition space is quite small, creating a discrepancy. Additionally, in terms of historical and cultural content, the supplementary educational material should be written diligently and logically, without errors. It should not be limited to just a word or two, casually placed next to an object, but should provide detailed information on the time period, origins, and significance.\u0026rdquo;\nThe results of this in-depth interview indicate that China still has a long way to go in the construction and promotion of red public spaces. Most interviewees expressed a negative willingness to participate in red public spaces, stating they \u0026ldquo;do not want to go\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;are not interested.\u0026rdquo; When asked for specific reasons, interviewees mentioned:\n\u0026ldquo;If it\u0026rsquo;s purely for ideological propaganda, to be a bit politically incorrect, I have no interest. But if it\u0026rsquo;s accompanied by items used by martyrs during the war, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just glasses, guns, or shoes, then I would be interested.\u0026rdquo;\nTo achieve better dissemination, red spaces and patriotic education need to consider the audience\u0026rsquo;s receptiveness. By demystifying theoretical knowledge and ideological propaganda and conveying them in an easily understandable manner, a more effective communication can be achieved. Interviewees hope that red public spaces go beyond long-term ideological propaganda and increase the frequency of material exhibitions. By showcasing objects from the wartime era that carry national memories, citizens can further embrace patriotic education.\nAudience Communication Contemporary young people demonstrate a strong dependence on the internet for obtaining information related to public spaces. The three interviewees in this in-depth study all expressed that they use the Xiaohongshu platform to search for relevant posts when planning their travels, drawing on others\u0026rsquo; experiences and planning their own travel routes based on these posts. Interviewee Wang Chenxi also mentioned that \u0026ldquo;occasionally coming across travel posts\u0026rdquo; enhances their desire to travel. It is evident that the internet has become an important medium for public space communication, and self-media recommendations have become a highly influential mode of communication. Therefore, in the process of portraying a country\u0026rsquo;s image using urban public spaces as the object, it is crucial to pay full attention to the power of internet self-media, make good use of the benefits of internet celebrities, and create a multifaceted new image of China in the modern era to counteract the stigmatization and demonization of China.\nThis in-depth interview also focused on the audience\u0026rsquo;s communication intentions, exploring the willingness of citizens to spread relevant content on the internet and the factors influencing this after engaging in urban public spaces. The research results are as follows:\n(1) Media Selection Dominated by \u0026ldquo;Acquaintance Socialization\u0026rdquo;\nWhen asked whether they would engage in behaviors such as writing or posting about their experiences in urban public spaces, the three interviewees showed a common preference for using platforms with \u0026ldquo;acquaintance socialization\u0026rdquo; characteristics, with friends\u0026rsquo; circles being the primary platform for posting content, while social media such as Weibo, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin were not their preferred choices.\nThe reasons given by the interviewees included \u0026ldquo;infrequent use\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lack of a posting habit.\u0026rdquo; It is worth noting that the interviewees mentioned that they did not have concerns about privacy breaches but rather that they do not frequently share content on social media platforms and are not accustomed to this form of life sharing.\nWhile it may be coincidental that the three interviewees are all inactive users of social media platforms, we still need to consider the possibility of low willingness among young people to post content related to urban public spaces and reflect on the strengths and weaknesses in international communication. Recommendations on this point will be detailed in the following sections.\n(2) Content-Led Space Selection\nEspecially for non-tourist spots or landmark buildings in urban public spaces, the software facilities (such as activities) and hardware facilities (such as architectural aesthetics) of the space become the main factors influencing the audience\u0026rsquo;s communication willingness. Regarding activities, the interviewees expressed a desire for authorities to hold regular events in urban public spaces, as this would greatly stimulate participants\u0026rsquo; interest and enhance their willingness to communicate.\nIn general, activities with the following characteristics are more likely to enhance the audience\u0026rsquo;s communication willingness:\nAesthetic appeal: Activities should embody visual and auditory aesthetics and artistic features. Novelty: They should broaden the audience\u0026rsquo;s knowledge and satisfy their curiosity. Entertainment: Audiences should be able to entertain themselves fully, and the effects of internet celebrities and celebrities can further stimulate audience participation and communication. Economic viability: Audiences seek activities that offer value for money. Wang Chenxi: \u0026ldquo;Because recently, Anaya had a Christmas event, and it seemed to have a lighting ceremony. When I saw it, I really wanted to go, but it was quite expensive. The hotel was already expensive, and it became even more expensive at Christmas, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t go.\u0026rdquo;\nLi Siyuan: \u0026ldquo;I always feel that things with strong color contrasts or eye-catching shapes make me visually enjoy them more, and I can take really nice photos to post on my friends\u0026rsquo; circle.\u0026rdquo;\nZhang Mu: \u0026ldquo;I mainly look at exhibitions or visit museums and then post on my friends\u0026rsquo; circle. On one hand, it\u0026rsquo;s visually appealing, and on the other hand, I want to show off by posting these high-end things, making me appear elegant and sophisticated.\u0026rdquo;\n(3) Prominence-Led Space Selection\n\u0026ldquo;Prominence-led space selection\u0026rdquo; specifically refers to spaces such as tourist attractions and landmark buildings that are more favored by visitors. A rough search of urban public space images on the internet shows that there are more pictures of well-known scenic spots like the Temple of Heaven and the Forbidden City, aligning with tourists\u0026rsquo; psychological tendencies.\nTourist spots, scenic areas, and landmarks embody the cultural characteristics and historical heritage of regions, cities, and even countries, making them important subjects for political and cultural communication. Strengthening the emphasis on these public spaces is crucial for the external communication of a country\u0026rsquo;s image. Further details on this will be elaborated in the subsequent sections.\nDevelopment Recommendations In the course of this in-depth interview, the interviewees made two suggestions regarding the development and planning of public spaces in Beijing:\n(1) Technological Empowerment\nThe interviewee, Wang Chenxi, mentioned the empowerment of urban public spaces with digital technology, especially for spaces such as scenic spots and historical buildings that are difficult to modify.\nWang Chenxi: \u0026ldquo;Beijing has many ancient towers and buildings, like the Drum Tower. When you visit these places, you may just glance at them as historical relics without fully appreciating their historical value. Similar situations occur with the ancient city towers in Xi\u0026rsquo;an. If activities, such as murder mystery events, were held inside these buildings, utilizing their historical context to engage visitors, it would add more meaning. However, if these spaces remain inaccessible, they are merely preserved but not fully utilized.\u0026rdquo;\nThe current prevalent digital technology used for urban public spaces is digital exhibition halls, but they offer limited physical engagement for users and fail to effectively convey the intrinsic value of public spaces to the audience. There is a need to enhance the practical application of emerging technologies in digitizing historical buildings, using digital entertainment as a means to increase public participation and dissemination of urban public spaces.\n(2) Unified Style\nSpecifically concerning the urban planning of Beijing, the interviewees believe there is a need to balance history and modernity, construction and preservation, to achieve stylistic consistency in architecture. The disharmony in Beijing\u0026rsquo;s public spaces arises from the juxtaposition of classical and modern architecture, hindering the formation of a unified cultural domain within the space. Strengthening this aspect could potentially enhance the public\u0026rsquo;s willingness to engage and communicate further.\nLi Siyuan: \u0026ldquo;Near the Olympic Forest Park, where I previously visited the Chinese Academy of History, some highly modernized buildings appeared. These structures, possibly constructed during the building of the Olympic Park to align with its theme, featured a mix of metallic modernity that slightly stood out. Alongside these were government buildings with a very serious classical style and museums attempting to portray the traditional red walls and green tiles style. This clash of historical styles in close proximity\u0026hellip; I understand Beijing\u0026rsquo;s challenges with its large population and diverse urban services, leading to the construction of numerous buildings. However, this process often results in conflicting initial plans being continually superseded by new ones, resulting in a somewhat orderly but personally disagreeable urban landscape.\u0026rdquo;\nSummary, Analysis, and Design Hardware Planning (1) Creating a People-Oriented and Livable Urban Environment\nRegarding internal dissemination, the current focus remains on creating a livable and harmonious city, in line with current policy directions and basic requirements. However, at the operational level, it is essential to solicit opinions from various sources and consider the actual needs of the people in their daily lives. In this regard, the empirical research conducted by our group may play a significant role.\n(2) Grounded in Local Culture, Constructing Unique Spaces\nThis recommendation stems from empirical research results. The materiality of urban public spaces can influence their communicative effects to some extent. Therefore, spaces should embody cultural characteristics that can be symbolized or easily symbolized, showcasing regional and national features. Locally grounded spaces with cultural distinctiveness can enhance users\u0026rsquo; national pride and cohesion, strengthen civic cultural identity, and boost cultural confidence. In international communication, such spaces can help foreign individuals and social groups gain a multifaceted understanding of China, counteracting existing stereotypes and improving China\u0026rsquo;s international image.\n(3) Embracing Individuality by Moving Away from Over-Design\nOften, human spatial behaviors, lifestyles, and identity cannot be \u0026ldquo;designed\u0026rdquo; but rather observed, respected, accommodated, and guided. Officially designated public spaces, despite meticulous design, can become overly managed or commercialized, leading to spaces imbued with a sense of regulation that may pressure participants.\nCommunication Methods (1) Constructing a Multidimensional Outbound Communication Matrix\nAs mentioned earlier, the likelihood of the youth group in posting content related to urban public spaces being low needs to be considered. However, for urban public spaces to reach the masses, they must undergo a process of symbolization, based on internet platforms and social media as mediators. Simultaneously, in accessing information about China, foreign populations have far fewer channels compared to domestic audiences, making social media a critical element. Hence, the willingness of the audience to communicate internationally is more critical than domestically, requiring a higher level of professionalism from communicators. Thus, our group believes that the focus of international communication should not be on encouraging ordinary people to participate and increase their willingness to communicate but on organizing official elites, professional communicators, and grassroots organizations to construct an outbound communication matrix through official media, official social media accounts, self-media, and other diverse forces, forming a communication method more suitable for the internet era.\n(2) Balancing Seriousness and Entertainment in Parallel\nCurrently, China\u0026rsquo;s external communication heavily relies on official media and accounts for content dissemination. While this approach allows professionals to determine the content of communication, ensuring a positive, proactive, and authentic image of China, it may lead to resistance from foreign populations already holding stereotypical impressions of China. Official symbols\u0026rsquo; appearance could potentially trigger resistance, hampering effective content delivery and perpetuating stereotyped perceptions of China. Therefore, our group believes that prioritizing entertainment methods is essential, combining seriousness with entertainment to enhance external outputs. In past global ideological struggles, some nations have proven the effectiveness of entertainment in shaping ideologies, using entertainment products like films, books, and music to convey their national values. Today, the majority of ordinary people still lack the resilience to resist entertainment shaping ideologies. Therefore, our group emphasizes the power of entertainment in China\u0026rsquo;s cultural externalization, advocating for a change in the current paradigm through localized adaptations of the above methods to suit the national context, thereby subtly influencing international thoughts and perceptions.\nReference [[1]] 刘思达.社会空间：从齐美尔到戈夫曼[J].社会学研究,2023,38(04):142-159+229.\n[[2]] 陈竹,叶珉.什么是真正的公共空间?——西方城市公共空间理论与空间公共性的判定[J].国际城市规划,2009,24(03):44-49+53.\n[[3]] 营立成.迈向什么样的空间社会学——空间作为社会学对象的四种路径与反思[J].中国社会科学评价,2019,(01):50-63+142-143.\n[[4]] 刘儒,陈舒霄,王迪.城市居民感知的公共空间正义测度与优化[J].统计与信息论坛,2022,37(10):89-102.\n[[5]] 桑劲,潘珂,孔诗雨.城市公共空间“自下而上”供给机制研究[J].城市发展研究,2023,30(07):79-87.\n[[6]] 孙振华.公共艺术的观念[J].艺术评论,2009(07):48-53+47.\n[[7]] 杨文会.论现代城市中的公共空间艺术[J].河北大学学报(哲学社会科学版),2004,(04):56-58.\n[[8]] 周成璐.社会学视角下的公共艺术[J].上海大学学报(社会科学版),2005,(04):92-98.\n[[9]] 邹锋.公共艺术的社会性[J].文艺研究,2005,(08):143-144.\n[[10]] 孙振华.公共艺术的观念[J].艺术评论,2009(07):48-53+47.\n[[11]] 赵君香.视觉传播语境中城市博物馆的公共空间设计——以洛杉矶盖提博物馆为例[J].装饰,2015,(03):128-129.\n[[12]] 林元城,章佳茵,李路华等.城市情感地理与空间治理:广州市区宣传类户外广告案例[J].世界地理研究,2021,30(05):1083-1095.\n[[13]] 苏状.公共屏幕传播与公共空间重构[J].南京社会科学,2012,(09):88-94+109.\n[[14]] 陈霖.城市认同叙事的展演空间——以苏州博物馆新馆为例[J].新闻与传播研究,2016,23(08):49-66+127.\n[[15]] 严亚,董小玉.城市空间“场景”中的青年媒介想象[J].南京社会科学,2017(04):113-117+132.\n[[16]] 潘霁.地理媒介,生活实验艺术与市民对城市的权利——评《地理媒介:网络化城市与公共空间的未来》[J].新闻记者,2017,(11):76-81.\n[[17]] 汤筠冰.论城市公共空间视觉传播的表征与重构[J].现代传播(中国传媒大学学报),2020,42(10):25-30.\n[[18]] 李佳一.论景观社会的城市文化新景观[J].艺术百家,2013,29(S2):62-68.\n[[19]] 于爽,王玉玮.影像的城市空间与现代性呈现——第五届中国影视青年论坛综述[J].现代传播(中国传媒大学学报),2017,39(05):158.\n[[1]] 来源：光明日报报道《新中国70年国家形象的建构》\n[[2]] 郑晨予.城市形象虚拟塑造的中国化与全球化——兼论与国家形象承载力的转换视角[J].社会科学家,2016(02):29-33.\n[[3]] 潇潇.新媒体时代的国家形象与城市形象互动[J].新闻传播,2020(02):108-109.\n[[4]] 谭震.城市形象与国家形象建构的关系及功能研究——基于近三年对外传播优秀城市案例的分析[J].国际传播,2021(03):78-85.\n[[5]] 宗海勇.空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究[J].南通大学学报(社会科学版),2018,34(06):109-115.\n[[6]] 来源：新华社报道《北京：向着国际一流的和谐宜居之都迈进》\n[[7]] 叶涯剑.空间社会学的方法论和基本概念解析[J].贵州社会科学,2006(01):68-70.\n[[8]] 宗海勇.空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究[J].南通大学学报(社会科学版),2018,34(06):109-115.\n[[9]] 吴欣彦.乡村振兴背景下乡村公共文化空间整体形象建构与传播路径[J].新闻爱好者,2023,(02):76-78.DOI:10.16017/j.cnki.xwahz.2023.02.024\n[[10]] 路璐,吴昊.多重张力中大运河文化遗产与国家形象话语建构研究[J].浙江社会科学,2021(02):133-139+132+159-160.\n[[11]] 李琳,林子苏.从“718联合厂”到“798艺术区”：时代契机与文化重构的双重历史表征[J].美术研究,2022(05):120-124.DOI:10.13318/j.cnki.msyj.2022.05.016.\n[[12]] 方李莉.城市艺术区的人类学研究——798艺术区探讨所带来的思考[28][J].民族艺术,2016(02):20-27+47.DOI:10.16564/j.cnki.1003-2568.2016.02.003.\n[[13]] https://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2013/content_2441018.htm\n[[14]] 隋岩,群聚传播——互联网的本质[J].现代传播,2023.\n","date":"2023-11-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/beijing-public-space/BJCityImage1_hu1f302096153c0d30868a6e1ab9e62269_46915_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/beijing-public-space/","title":"【Academic Research】A Study on Beijing's Urban Public Spaces and National Image."},{"content":" The present article represents a collaborative effort completed by five co-authors, with my contribution focusing specifically on the literature review and data processing sections.

Through this investigation, the research aims to clarify how dimensions of perceived trust and perceived risk affect users\u0026rsquo; adoption willingness and to discern the roles played by information quality and hot level within the context of perceived trust.\nLiterature Review Research on User-Generated Content (UGC) User-Generated Content (UGC) emerged within the framework of Web 2.0, referring to user-driven participation in online platform development where they actively share and display their owned or created content. With the launch of video platform YouTube in 2005, the UGC model swiftly became a focal point in digital content evolution. Scholarly research on both theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of UGC has gradually burgeoned, leading to increased attention from various industries. New media platforms widely adopt the UGC model, relying on users for the integration and management of online resource information. [4]\nIn its early days, studies on UGC in new media primarily focused on video and blogging platforms. Sungmyung Huh [5] et al. employed the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory to investigate users\u0026rsquo; satisfaction and motivations behind using UGC platforms, asserting that self-expression constitutes a primary factor driving users to share and create videos on these platforms. Choi et al. [6] and Kim et al. [7], through their studies on video and blog platforms, posited that information interaction is a critical characteristic of UGC, emphasizing that user interfaces need to be designed adaptively to facilitate direct interaction between users and platform activities. Jae [8] also explored the effects of user control, synchronicity, and responsiveness on new media services and user information perception based on information interaction theories.\nAs mobile Internet became mainstream and the transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0 unfolded, the applicability of the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory came under scrutiny. Ichimizu Hoshi [9] analyzed four case studies related to UGC and argued that this theory overlooks the trend of audiences transitioning into communicators in the new media era, attempting to break away from traditional media analysis frameworks and presenting a thought-provoking critical perspective. Overall, UGC research in new media mainly concentrates on three dimensions: platform users, interactive content, and new media technologies.\nHealth Information Adoption Studies In 1948, when the World Health Organization was founded, health was defined as \u0026ldquo;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u0026rdquo;\nBroadly speaking, health information encompasses all knowledge, news, data, facts, and materials related to health or illness. With the widespread adoption of the internet and mobile devices, the boundaries of health information dissemination have expanded, barriers have been broken down, and the conventional healthcare environment has progressively transformed into an online space for exchange and sharing. The health information discussed in this study within the context of new media platforms refers to web-based health information broadly relating to people\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental health, illnesses, nutrition, wellness, and can be roughly categorized into two types: health and medical information and health lifestyle information. [10] In recent years, a series of user information behaviors associated with health information, such as searching, acquisition, evaluation, application, and feedback, have increasingly attracted attention.\nHealth information adoption refers to the aggregate of all stages of behavior from the acquisition to the utilization of health information by individuals. [11] Closely related concepts include information reception, which typically implies passive receipt of information, whereas information adoption emphasizes the proactive agency of the individual. Current research on health information adoption largely falls into two categories: one focusing on causes, investigating which factors influence individuals\u0026rsquo; adoption of health information, and another concentrating on outcomes, exploring the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors.\nTraditional research on health information adoption tends to lean towards the causal aspect. The classic Information Adoption Model (IAM) was proposed by Sussman and Siegal, who built upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), suggesting that information adoption behavior is mediated by perceived usefulness, which in turn is influenced by the quality of arguments and the credibility of information sources. [12] Subsequent studies on the influencing factors of health information adoption mostly base their investigations on this model. For instance, Deng Shengli et al., drawing from TAM2 and IAM, incorporated perceived risk into a new model and conducted empirical research on health information adoption among users of Q\u0026amp;A platforms through questionnaire surveys. [13] Additionally, other scholars have delved into alternative factors potentially affecting health information adoption. Mo Xiuting et al., for example, examined the influence of health self-efficacy on health information adoption, finding it could serve as both a moderator and mediator variable. [14] Han Xiaoxiao et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on health information adoption among urban elderly revealed that individual social capital impacts their health information adoption. [15]\nIn recent times, the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors has also garnered interest from researchers. Some scholars suggest that examining the relationship between changes in health behaviors and health information adoption can provide informational support for modifying individual health behaviors, effectively promoting the change of unhealthy behaviors and enhancing personal health management capabilities. [16] [17] Therefore, research on health information adoption is currently in a stage where both causality and outcome are considered equally important. [18]\nDomestic Research on Health Information Adoption on UGC Platforms Regarding health information adoption on video-based UGC platforms, Peng Sihao et al. [19] studied the communication characteristics of health-related short videos on Douyin (TikTok) and the factors influencing user information behavior. They found that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively affect user information behavior while perceived risk negatively influences it. In the process of disseminating health-related short videos, information quality, source credibility, users\u0026rsquo; health concerns, and subjective norms all exert positive effects on information adoption. Li Li et al. [20] established a research framework for the adoption of health-related short video information based on the Information Adoption Theory and the Heuristic-Systematic Model. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), they analyzed the effect paths of antecedent variables on user health information adoption and employed Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to explore the combined effects of influential conditions on short video users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption. SEM results showed that content quality, platform reputation, and source credibility significantly impact perceived usefulness, which in turn affects users\u0026rsquo; adoption intention; content quality and perceived usefulness act as chain mediators in the effect of expressiveness on adoption intention. fsQCA analysis revealed that users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption decisions on short videos are jointly influenced by systematic and heuristic cues. Wang Xinglan et al. [21] constructed a theoretical model based on the Uses and Gratifications Theory, Health Belief Model, and Elaboration Likelihood Model, discovering that social gratification needs, learning gratification needs, perceived health threats, and perceived health expectations positively influence information adoption behavior, while argument quality, source credibility, and video appeal indirectly affect information adoption.\nIn the context of specialized online health communities, Liu Zhu [22] introduced perceived trust as a mediating variable and used information quality and information popularity derived from conformity theory to measure users\u0026rsquo; perceived trust. Perceived risk was used as an independent variable affecting both perceived trust and user information adoption, with health self-efficacy serving as another independent variable influencing user information adoption. Findings suggested that information quality (source reliability, information accuracy, and timeliness) significantly positively impacts perceived trust; information popularity significantly positively influences perceived trust; perceived risk significantly negatively affects perceived trust but does not significantly influence user information adoption; both perceived trust and health self-efficacy positively and significantly affect user information adoption. Perceived trust partially mediates the relationship between information quality and user information adoption, and fully mediates the relationship between information popularity and user information adoption. Zhu Yunqin et al. [23] utilized the Elaboration Likelihood Model combined with Information Need Theory to examine how high-level central processing (information quality) and low-level peripheral processing (carrier quality and source credibility) in an online health community environment affect users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness, subsequently influencing their information search behavior. Their findings indicated that for peripheral processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by source credibility and carrier quality; for central processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by information quality. Moreover, the relationships between information quality and source credibility with users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness are negatively moderated by the motivational variable of information need.\nResearch Methodology Research Hypotheses Based on the theory of health self-efficacy, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH1: Health self-efficacy among college students positively affects their health information adoption.\nConsidering that health information quality comprises aspects like accuracy and timeliness [33], and taking into account the strong emotional nature of content expression on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), this study adds information emotional intensity to the concept of information quality. Drawing from relevant theories of the Information Adoption Model, the following hypotheses are put forward:\nH2: The quality of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2a: The emotional intensity of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2b: The accuracy of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2c: The timeliness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nDrawing from theories related to the Information Adoption Model and referencing Chou et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on source credibility, the following hypotheses are presented:\nH3: The credibility of health information sources on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3a: The credibility of health information providers on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3b: The platform credibility of Xiaohongshu positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nGrounded in Social Influence Theory, the following hypotheses are advanced:\nH4: Social influence of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4a: User consensus on health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4b: The popularity or information热度 of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nConsistent with the Information Adoption Model, the final hypothesis is:\nH5: College students\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences their health information adoption.\nQuestionnaire Structure Design The survey questionnaire consists of two main sections: a Likert scale section and a section collecting basic information about the respondents. The Likert-scale portion is structured as a matrix with 3-6 items designed for each dimension based on the research model and hypotheses. The basic information section primarily gathers data on the gender, educational level, and major of the respondents.\nPast studies have shown that medical and social science majors exhibit relatively higher levels of media literacy when processing and accepting information, with no significant statistical differences observed among other majors. Consequently, this study targets college students from medical, social science, and other majors, administering the same standardized questionnaire across three independent surveys.\nThe research questionnaire is divided into three parts:\nIntroduction: This part outlines the purpose of the survey, assures confidentiality of responses, and expresses gratitude to the participants. It also defines the scope and definition of health information before filtering out participants who have browsed or read health information on Xiaohongshu, focusing primarily on those who have had exposure to such content. Core Content: This section contains the heart of the questionnaire, measuring five constructs within the research model through 37 measurement items: Health Self-Efficacy (5 items) Information Quality (10 items): Information Emotional Intensity (4 items) Information Accuracy (3 items) Information Timeliness (3 items) Source Credibility (7 items): Platform Credibility (3 items) Provider Credibility (4 items) Social Influence (6 items): User Consensus (2 items) Information Popularity (4 items) Perceived Usefulness (4 items) Health Information Adoption (5 items) All measurement items utilize a 5-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neutral, 4: agree, 5: strongly agree). Personal Information: This part collects demographic details, including gender, academic status, and specific field of study. Pilot Survey and Questionnaire Revision The pilot questionnaire consisted of 15 questions, including 11 Likert scale items and 4 personal information questions. A pilot survey was conducted among university students in Beijing, resulting in 123 questionnaires distributed and 73 valid responses, giving an effective return rate of 59.35%. Based on the pilot survey data analysis, several improvements were made:\nSince there was almost no correlation between the respondent\u0026rsquo;s school and their usage or adoption behaviors, the item asking about the \u0026ldquo;school attended\u0026rdquo; was removed. Instead, the \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; question was refined to provide clearer and more precise options. Some items in the Likert scale had low factor loadings or lacked specificity, indicating low effectiveness. Such invalid items were eliminated from the final questionnaire. The revised formal questionnaire comprised 11 matrix Likert scale sets and 3 basic information questions, with a reduction in the number of questions within the matrices and improved clarity and consistency in their phrasing and logical sequence.\nFormal Sampling Survey For the formal survey, three criteria were set for selecting participants: (1) they must have used the Xiaohongshu platform, (2) they must have a certain degree of interest in health information, and (3) they must be currently enrolled college students. Through snowball sampling, eligible participants were asked to recommend others who met these requirements.\nBased on 2021 data released by the Ministry of Education on the number of undergraduate students by discipline category, the ratio of students in the medical category to those in four other categories (law, education, management, and economics) was approximately 1:4. This ratio was approximated for the Beijing student population to ensure a consistent sample size ratio in the two comparative studies.\nThe formal survey began on June 19, 2023, and ended on June 25, 2023, lasting for seven days. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed, 281 were returned, and 174 were deemed valid, yielding an effective recovery rate of 61.92%.\nThe data analysis section is omitted here; please refer to the attachment for details.\nReferences(partially) [4] 范哲, 朱庆华, 赵宇翔.

Against this backdrop, this social investigation selects Feng Village in Beiliu City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as the research subject, describing the current status of the integrated development of the three industries in Feng Village. It also explores the existing issues in the process of the three industries\u0026rsquo; integration driving rural revitalization, and discusses feasible suggestions. Since 2016, Feng Village has achieved a significant increase in per capita income and village collective income through the leadership of local leading enterprises, the development of the Tongshiling Tourist Area, and the entrepreneurship of returned village talents. However, the rapid development of Feng Village is faced with challenges such as obstacles in the development of the three industries, uneven growth, and low level of integration. In response to this, this survey offers relevant suggestions from various perspectives including the government, village collectives, leading enterprises, and villagers. The author believes that under the current development status of Feng Village, achieving rural revitalization still requires collaborative efforts from all parties, in order to inscribe a magnificent chapter of the integration of the three industries and rural revitalization on the fertile land of Feng Village.\nKeywords: Tertiary Sector Integration, Rural Revitalization, Local Elites, Collective Economy, Prosperous Villages\nThis is an earlier piece of writing and there is no English version written yet.\nView the full paper (CN)\n","date":"2022-09-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/fengcun-industry/Fengcun1_hu4b90aa73295deec627e88d85072e2cbc_393216_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/fengcun-industry/","title":"【Academic Research】Fertile soil and abundant water, the revitalization through \"copper\" — Exploring the integration of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in Feng Village to boost rural revitalization."},{"content":"Introduction On March 11th, the documentary Guarding Liberation West 3, co-produced by the Changsha Public Security Bureau and Bilibili, came to a successful conclusion, amassing over 200 million views and sparking heated discussions. Throughout the series, it featured both bizarre incidents that left viewers laughing and crying, as well as thrilling on-site arrests, showcasing both the stern and rigorous law enforcement procedures and heartwarming grassroots services. Behind the hustle and bustle, the guardians never rest; in recent years, documentaries focusing on law enforcement have increasingly attracted the younger generation. Today, let us take a step into these \u0026ldquo;outposts\u0026rdquo; that serve and protect the people, gaining an understanding of the most authentic front lines of police work.\nGuarding Liberation West The Guarding Liberation West series is a legal education documentary centered around the daily work of police officers in Changsha, Hunan Province. This documentary deeply showcases the routine tasks of urban police officers in the central business district of a metropolis, revealing the intricate interplay of law, reason, emotion, and reality within complex policing situations through activities such as police patrols, multi-departmental cooperation, suspect interrogations, and involvement in major cases. It portrays a vivid image of responsible, rational, and compassionate police officers, and disseminates relevant safety and legal knowledge to the public through various case stories. The featured police officers in the show have distinct characteristics, each with their own areas of expertise and endearing personalities, which constitutes one of the main attractions of Guarding Liberation West.\nThanks to the rich experience of Hunan TV in producing variety shows, and due to the everyday, relatable nature of the cases depicted in Guarding Liberation West, the program infuses a certain level of entertainment into the rigorous process of law enforcement, ensuring seriousness while also catering to viewers\u0026rsquo; preferences for amusement. In the bar and commercial districts, an abundance of civil disturbances resulting from alcohol consumption serve as a recurring thread throughout the three episodes. Incidents under the influence of alcohol can sometimes jeopardize public safety, create misunderstandings, appear absurdly comical, or lead to tragedies. The show captures life\u0026rsquo;s nuances vividly in minor incidents while maintaining strict rigor in significant matters, providing viewers with a delightful viewing experience.\nGuarding Liberation West is filled with wit, humor, and laugh-out-loud moments, telling stories of human life and its vicissitudes in the Liberation West area of Changsha, portraying the spirit, unique personalities, and selfless dedication of grassroots police officers in the new era. While conducting serious legal education, it also offers a sense of relaxation and enjoyment, making it an essential companion during meals.\nBig City, No Small Matters Big City, No Small Matters is a police documentary produced by Oriental Satellite TV. Unlike Guarding Liberation West, this program shifts its focus from grassroots police station affairs to the actions against crime, concentrating on criminal and economic cases in Shanghai (referred to as \u0026lsquo;Shen City\u0026rsquo;). The show embeds itself within various criminal investigation and economic investigation teams across Shanghai, closely following the processes of solving cases involving forensic science, anti-theft, anti-fraud, plainclothes operations, major cases, and drug enforcement. Viewers can experience the intensity firsthand through the lens, accompanying law enforcement officers to the front lines of capturing suspects, immersively feeling the tense atmosphere and recreating the thrilling moments of apprehension.\nCriminal and economic crimes are more serious and hardcore compared to civil cases. This series covers not only recurring heinous acts such as drug trafficking and tax evasion but also new forms of crime like online and telecommunications fraud. The show particularly highlights these novel criminal methods, serving as a stark reminder that \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rsquo;s net is vast and though it may have gaps, none can escape.\u0026rdquo; It further embodies the professional attitude of investigative teams who constantly monitor and vigilantly protect society. A thought-provoking aspect is that a significant number of suspects involved in online fraud are young people adept at internet technology, yet often lack knowledge about relevant laws, only realizing they\u0026rsquo;ve broken the law upon arrest. This underscores the importance of economic legal education. Concurrently, elderly individuals are more susceptible to falling victim to online scams, making it an urgent social development issue to integrate this demographic into an increasingly digital payment-dominated environment.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re drawn to the hardcore elements of criminal and economic investigations, eager to explore the strategies behind cracking major cases, or simply wish to experience the adrenaline rush of frontline law enforcement, Big City, No Small Matters might just be the perfect fit for you.\nForensic Files Forensic Files is a police documentary produced by China Central Television, which uses a series of classic cases as a vehicle to narrate the entire process of case investigation from the perspective of forensic experts, tightly integrating criminalistics with detective work. Although the program mainly tells the story through the eyes of forensic experts, it presents a comprehensive view of all stages from identification to apprehension, featuring a tight pace and interlocking clues and motives, creating a strong sense of deduction that is both suspenseful and captivating.\nThe show particularly highlights the forensic criminal investigation techniques, which are highly specialized and core content. For instance, regarding the concept of time of death, Forensic Files provides detailed explanations: how forensic experts use specific methods to accurately estimate the time of death for victims, thereby providing solid evidence for detectives to solve cases.\nUnder the scalpel, the last words of the victims are conveyed; under the microscope, the wrongdoings of criminals are exposed. Forensic Files guides viewers to unravel the intricate details of cases, revealing all hidden truths. While solving cases, the program also conveys the noble professional spirit of forensic experts, who speak for the deceased and advocate for the rights of the living.\nObserving the dynamics of society, safeguarding local tranquility. Grassroots police officers, criminal investigation officers, and economic crime investigation officers jointly maintain the peace of the city, piecing together the truth like a puzzle, breaking through barriers amidst confusion to pinpoint the source of evil. You may rarely encounter them, but more often than not, they blend into the hustle and bustle of urban life and the everyday routines of the marketplace. In times of urgent police situations, they are the brave ones going against the tide; after the storm has passed, they shine as the most dazzling light in the sky above the city. Their brilliance may be hidden in the ordinary, yet their true colors still shine through even in understated ways.\n“Guarding Liberation West” “Forensic Files” “Guarding Liberation West” “Big City, No Small Matters” ","date":"2022-03-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/the-cold-and-warmth-of-the-police-station/t019aad1f5548ec9421_hu8e26b2051a5a96b9128394306a827e9c_280494_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2022/the-cold-and-warmth-of-the-police-station/","title":"The Cold and Warmth of the Police Station"},{"content":"Seagulls silent, traveler\u0026rsquo;s sentiment; red leaves aflame, heart of benevolence and righteousness. Setting Disclaimer: This is a derivative creation, all copyrights belong to miHoYo.\nAll plot elements are purely fictional and unrelated to any historical figures or nations.\nIntroduction In a time of extreme instability across the globe, the General suddenly issued a Sword Hunt Decree, ordering the confiscation of swords carried by civilians, which incited discontent among various samurai factions and civilian organizations, leading them to unite and form a resistance army. Despite being intended to stabilize society, this decision only exacerbated social unrest. Amidst the chaos, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend bravely ventured forth alone to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at the Imperial Court, witnessing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen figure. Forced to flee with his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, Wanye inherited his friend\u0026rsquo;s legacy and was rescued by pirates during his pursuit, ultimately fostering collaboration between the pirates and the resistance army. Raising the banner of rebellion, Wanye finally stood before the General, using his sense of righteousness to illustrate the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nCharacter Settings Wanye: A wandering samurai hailing from a once-proud but now destitute samurai family. Courteous in demeanor, gentle yet romantic, he enjoys composing poetry and displays the carefree spirit of a rōnin while nurturing a deep compassion for the suffering of all living beings. He remains calm and contented, cherishing nature and possessing acute hearing and exceptional martial prowess, especially fond of maple leaves. His voice quality is youthful, primarily resonating in the larynx with a hint of chest resonance; his pronunciation originates near the hard palate. Friend: A wandering samurai characterized by his open and bold personality, determined and valiant, with a heart set on sacrificing himself to save others. Skilled in martial arts, he believes himself to be the one capable of standing before the General to remonstrate, choosing to do so single-handedly, ultimately falling in combat within the Imperial Court but leaving a lasting impact through his courage and sense of righteousness. The General: The ruler, revered by the populace as a War God, having undergone significant personal changes following multiple wars where her loved ones perished, gradually becoming detached from the people. She pursued the concept of \u0026ldquo;eternal immutability\u0026rdquo; and enacted the Sword Hunt Decree to maintain national stability. Eventually, she comes to realize the decree\u0026rsquo;s irrationality under the influence of Wanye and his friend. Big Sister: The leader of the pirate gang, known for her bold and straightforward demeanor. She particularly appreciates Wanye\u0026rsquo;s poetic talents. Strategist: The leader of the resistance army advocating for the right of civilians to carry swords, believing that the collective power of the people could sway the General\u0026rsquo;s stance. [Voice acting guidance for each character should refer to the original game soundtrack.]\nOutline Act 1: The Encounter of Wanye and His Friend Act 2: Conversation Aboard the Ship Act 3: The Early Stages of the Sword Hunt Decree - The Friend\u0026rsquo;s Remonstration and Departure Act 4: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Fugitive Experience Act 5: Pirates and the Resistance Army Act 6: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Advice Finale: Wanye Honors His Friend Synopsis During a period of intense global instability, the General unexpectedly instigated a Sword Hunt Decree, aiming to collect privately-owned swords, causing dissatisfaction among various samurais and civilian groups, who consequently coalesced into a resistance force. The policy, initially designed to stabilize the nation, instead triggered massive societal upheaval. In the tumultuous times, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend ventured solo to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at court, seeing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen silhouette. Taking his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and fleeing, Wanye, inheriting his friend\u0026rsquo;s aspirations, united with pirates during his escape, leading to cooperation between pirates and the resistance army. Ultimately, he faced the General with a compassionate heart, demonstrating the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPlay Act I: The Sleeve Fluttering in Autumn Wind Asking for Red Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Acquaintance\nSetting: A forest clearing in the wilderness\n[Environmental Sounds] {Wan Ye kneels down to play a leaf whistle, finishing with reciting poetry}\nWan Ye: Traversing the deep mountains amidst red leaves, my ears ask after deer’s song.

(pauses for 1 second) Your clothes may seem tattered at first glance, but the design is incredibly intricate. If I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken, the maple leaf pattern on your attire is your family crest, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nWan Ye: So what if it is? Are you here to rob me, or to duel?\nAcquaintance: Haha, maybe just to compare swords. {Both draw their blades and charge towards each other}\n[Sounds of footsteps][Clashing of blades]\nWan Ye and Acquaintance: (grunting and exerting effort during the sword exchange)\nWan Ye: Huh {Wan Ye parries the blade}[Their swords lock momentarily]\nAcquaintance: Good swordsmanship! (laughs) How did you manage to spot me just now?\nWan Ye: I can hear the wind\u0026rsquo;s voice, and it grew unusually restless just now, suggesting you\u0026rsquo;re someone who can\u0026rsquo;t keep still. Yet, I also detect no malice in you.\nAcquaintance: Haha, even though you sensed no ill intent, your strike was quite fierce.\nWan Ye: When comparing swords, one naturally gives it their all; otherwise, how could we justify the stirring of the wind. But I believe that chance encounters have their own significance. My name is Wan Ye, and yours?\n{Sound fades out as the memory ends}\n[End of Flashback]\nAct II: The Oceanic Gale That Hurts Maple Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Acquaintance\nSetting: Onboard a ship\n[Gradually intensifying sea breeze] {Wan Ye wakes up from a dream, feeling a bit of a headache}\n(Allow breathing sounds for 2 seconds)\nWan Ye: Ah (sighs)\n{Sister Leader walks up to engage in conversation, footsteps on wooden deck}\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, we\u0026rsquo;re about to set sail soon. What are you daydreaming about here?\nWan Ye: Just reminiscing about some past events.\nSister Leader: Speaking of past events, I really did bring this unknown and potentially dangerous element onto the ship.\nWan Ye: (chuckles lightly) Sister Leader, you jest. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t time before to explain. (pauses for 1 second) My past\u0026hellip; the most memorable part was when I lived as a wandering samurai, drifting without roots, no fixed abode, yet there were benefits. Staying too long in one place would create a distance between me and nature. Perhaps wandering is indeed the lifestyle most suited for me.\nSister Leader: Wandering and drifting, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like our life on this ship, sailing with the waves, never anchoring for long at any port.\nWan Ye: But my life might be more akin to a maple leaf dancing in the wind, unattached to anything, free from burdens and attachments, acquainting myself with all things under heaven and earth, inhaling the essence of the four directions—this is the state I enjoy.\nSister Leader: Why the maple leaf?\nWan Ye: I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an affinity for maple leaves, though they often symbolize partings during their crimson season.\nSister Leader: But the red leaves are like fire, passionate and radiant.\nWan Ye: Yes, indeed they are.\nSister Leader: I have another question—how did a wanderer like you end up being wanted by your lord?\nWan Ye: {Wan Ye lifts his sword} That story begins with the owner of this very sword.\nAct III: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Passerby\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: He used to be my closest friend. That day he asked me about\u0026hellip; {soliloquy fades out}\n[Natural sounds, bird calls, etc.] {Wan Ye practices swordplay with his friend, both panting slightly afterwards}\nFriend: Wan Ye, have you ever heard of the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;?[Cat meows] {Wan Ye pets the cat}\nWan Ye: Of course, such a blade is only seen during divine retribution. It represents the pinnacle of the general\u0026rsquo;s martial arts prowess, symbolizing ultimate strength.\nFriend: However, that blade may not be entirely unattainable. There are living beings on earth who dare to face the might of thunderbolts.\nWan Ye: Nonetheless, currently, my swordsmanship cannot compare to that of the general.\nFriend: Haha, aiming for it is still a worthy goal nonetheless.\nWan Ye: (light chuckle) Mm.\nFriend: I will dedicate my life to pursuing the utmost limit of martial arts, to confront that \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;.\nWan Ye: But I\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered, why do we travel far and wide, honing our swordsmanship? What does a samurai\u0026rsquo;s sword truly mean? Before my wandering days, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the meaning of swordsmanship within the remnants of my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings.\nFriend: Wan Ye, if someday our land is eroded by calamity, and its people are no longer under the watchful eye of the gods, what choice would you make?\nWan Ye: I suppose I\u0026rsquo;d choose to live a life of anonymity.\nFriend: Humph, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. {pats Wan Ye\u0026rsquo;s shoulder}\nWan Ye: Huh? [Cat meows]\n{Friend departs}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: Later, unexpectedly, the Sword Hunt Decree came into effect, and the people\u0026rsquo;s wishes gradually became bricks and mortar for constructing \u0026ldquo;eternity\u0026rdquo;. {soliloquy fades out}\n[Light rain] {Wan Ye walks down the street}\nPasserby A: (whispering) Have you heard about the Sword Hunt Decree\u0026hellip;\nPasserby B: Yeah, these days soldiers patrol the streets frequently, and occasionally you can hear the distant sound of swords clashing.\nPasserby A: It\u0026rsquo;s said that some samurais have formed a resistance army, demanding the repeal of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPasserby B: Actually, issuing the Sword Hunt Decree at this time\u0026hellip; {voice trails off}\nSamurai A: (whispering) What should we do in this situation?\nSamurai B: Maybe we should just surrender our swords obediently.\nSamurai A: (barely containing anger) How could we? The sword is\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Fleeing reluctantly, amidst flashing blades and tumultuous journeys, the land now sees samurai\u0026rsquo;s aspirations ruthlessly stripped away. Enduring warfare perplexes me, whether it\u0026rsquo;s due to samurai\u0026rsquo;s obstinacy or sudden policy shifts.\n{While Wan Ye contemplates, Passersby C and D discuss the Friend}\nPasserby C: There are unusually few patrolling soldiers today.\nPasserby D: Word has it that a wandering samurai challenged the general in a royal court duel today, which is why most soldiers are maintaining order. {Wan Ye stops, exhales heavily}\nPasserby C: This samurai is indeed brave. Challenging the general in a royal court duel is the sole means to demand change from those pursuing eternity, but failure means certain death.\nPasserby D: To defy the dignity of the \u0026lsquo;God of War\u0026rsquo; takes real courage.\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Could it be him\u0026hellip;\n{Wan Ye turns and sprints towards the royal palace} [Rain and footsteps fade out]\n[Rain and thunder sounds]\n{Wan Ye runs up the steps, panting}\n[At the moment Wan Ye reaches the royal court, lightning strikes, and the Friend falls]\nWan Ye: (inhales sharply in shock)\n{Wan Ye rushes forward to embrace the fallen Friend} [Hugging sound followed by the sound of the sword falling]\nWan Ye: (clenching teeth) {Wan Ye picks up his Friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and escapes, ending with the sound of getting up}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: The royal court duel is solemn and brutal; the loser faces divine punishment while the winner earns a turning point. Perhaps he thought himself the best candidate to stand up. Confronting the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; was his lifelong pursuit. When I arrived, the duel had ended, and all I heard was the sound of his sword hitting the ground after \u0026lsquo;divine retribution\u0026rsquo;. That must have been the radiance he sought to witness. In his final moments, what expression graced his face? There was no time to ponder; I seized his sword and fled. All I knew was that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t let his fervent wish be cast into a cold statue. {soliloquy ends}\nAfter the Third Act: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader\nSetting: Onboard the ship\nSister Leader: Your friend is truly admirable. Despite having different beliefs and ideals, you two conversed harmoniously, making it indeed a fateful encounter as you mentioned.\nWan Ye: Although I\u0026rsquo;ve never fully understood what samurais stubbornly pursue, upon picking up my friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, I finally comprehended his aspirations and convictions, and realized the significance of starting a journey with the sword for a samurai.\nSister Leader: You think this conviction must be witnessed by the general herself, hence why you convinced me to accept the resistance army\u0026rsquo;s employment.\nWan Ye: Sister Leader, you\u0026rsquo;re perceptive indeed. Even though you know of my personal motive, you won\u0026rsquo;t refuse this employment anymore.\nSister Leader: Such a fiery desire – I\u0026rsquo;m also curious whether it can shake the \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; upheld by the general.\nWan Ye: Many times, I questioned myself if my discontent with the general stemmed from that royal court duel or her decisive strike against my friend. But I realize it\u0026rsquo;s not that; I simply want righteousness to be met with righteousness. Is the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; truly unattainable? Perhaps one day, we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to confront that kind of overwhelming power, which is precisely why I want to return.\nConclusion of the Previous Episode Characters: The General\nSetting: Silent Royal Palace\nGeneral: Amidst this fleeting world, not only dreams can manifest in slumber; everything is ephemeral. The world is like a dream, and only \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; can protect all sentient beings. Desires are perhaps the most unstable factor. But, much like then, he charged forth fearlessly, much like you, sister.\nPrevious Episode Ends\nNext Episode Opening Characters: The General, Attendant\nSetting: Silent Imperial Residence\nGeneral: What is the current battle situation?\nAttendant: We\u0026rsquo;re still at a standoff; there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been an opportunity to wipe out the Resistance Army in one fell swoop.\nGeneral: (pondering) Hmm. Ordinarily isolated samurais have managed to form an alliance, despite differing philosophies. How have these diverse individuals come together and achieved a unity that rivals the military\u0026rsquo;s might? Such power cannot be ignored.\nAttendant: What orders do you have, General?\nGeneral: I will set out tomorrow to quell the Resistance Army. You may withdraw for now.\nAttendant: Understood. {Attendant retreats}\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Soliloquy: Changes brought about by samurais are not something \u0026lsquo;Eternity\u0026rsquo; tolerates, but this particular change does not instill unease in me.\nAct IV Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Pursuers\n[Sea Breeze][Flapping of sails][Surf Sound]\nWan Ye: The sound of the waves and the rustling of fine leaves in bamboo groves bear a striking resemblance.\nSister Leader: Ha, Wan Ye, I took the risk of sheltering you aboard this fleet not to listen to poetic musings.\nWan Ye: I know, but this moonlight before the great battle is something neither of us should waste. (sighs softly) It would be perfect with a flask of sake.\nSister Leader: You mean, the great battle?\nWan Ye: Yes. This scent in the wind, much like that night, signifies warning.\n{Flashback scene}\n{Wan Ye running}\nPursuer: Stop!\n{Wan Ye halts}\nWan Ye: (resigned sigh), Just one step away from the rendezvous port, and yet you still found me.\nPursuer: By the Sword Hunt Decree, hand over your swords.\nWan Ye: If you could make an exception for me, it might go smoother.\n{Wan Ye pivots}{Pause for 1s}\nPursuer: (astonished) Maple leaf?\n{Wan Ye draws his sword}\nPursuer: (cries out) Ahh! {Two voices here to indicate multiple pursuers}\n{End of flashback}\nWan Ye: Let\u0026rsquo;s lower the sails, Sister Leader; it\u0026rsquo;s time to brace for the storm.\n[Sound of a large ship moving]\nAct V Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Strategist, Rogue\n[Thunderclap][Ship anchors]\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, since you initiated this, you handle the liaison with the Resistance Army.\nWan Ye: Alright. Sister Leader, take a stroll around the harbor and wait for my message.\n{Wan Ye departs}\n{Sister Leader wanders around}\nSister Leader: Huh? There\u0026rsquo;s actually a poem written on this bulletin board: \u0026ldquo;This body is like autumn leaves adrift across mountains and seas.\u0026rdquo; Ha!\n{Sister Leader writes on the bulletin board}\nSister Leader: We\u0026rsquo;re back! Kid, write another poem!\nPasserby: Hey, this is a bulletin board, not a message board.\nSister Leader: Hahaha. [Voice fades out]\n{Wan Ye sits by the riverbank waiting for the Strategist}\nWan Ye: Clouds disperse above high skies, revealing the reflection of home in the sunset glow. Mm, [flourish of his sleeve] the last line.\n{An arrow whizzes by; Wan Ye dodges, arrow lands in water}\nWan Ye: Honestly, I already lack poetic talent, and then to be interrupted like this.\n{Wan Ye advances, his sword moves like a shadow, swiftly resolving the situation}\nWan Ye: Oh, I got it now. The last line is, \u0026ldquo;A wanderer\u0026rsquo;s heart drifts.\u0026rdquo;\n{Strategist applauds}\nStrategist: Wan Ye, you remain as sharp as ever. No wonder you escaped from the general\u0026rsquo;s grasp; looks like our Resistance Army will gain a formidable warrior.\nWan Ye: Strategist, you know why I\u0026rsquo;ve come. Our Resistance Army gains more than just a warrior.\nStrategist: What are your conditions?\nWan Ye: Sister Leader\u0026rsquo;s goal is simple: money and entertainment. As for me, I merely hope to advise the general, to share our way of the samurai.\nStrategist: That royal court duel\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I hold no grudge against the general. The winner gains an opportunity, the loser faces divine punishment – that\u0026rsquo;s the rule. But our voices should be heard by the general.\nStrategist: Our views align unexpectedly; we do not intend to provoke civil war. In the face of foreign threats, unity is paramount. However, the general\u0026rsquo;s decisions have left many samurais disillusioned. We assembled into an army not to rebel, but to impose order and reduce chaos. Since the general no longer accepts royal court duels, we can only\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I understand what Strategist intends. You hope to break through the heavily guarded imperial residence to directly advise the general.\nStrategist: Exactly. Currently, our samurai forces are evenly matched with the military. We need an unforeseen force to influence the battle. Moreover, according to reliable intelligence, the general will personally lead the troops soon, and we can use this opportunity to show our resolve to her.\nWan Ye: Resolve\u0026hellip; I doubt the general would merely listen based on that alone. For us samurai, what is the original intention behind wielding our swords\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nAct VI Characters: Wan Ye, The General, Sister Leader, Strategist, Samurai, Soldiers\nScene: Battlefield\n[Rendered battlefield][Thunderstorm sounds]\n(Samurai forces are retreating)\nSoldier A: The General is indeed extraordinary; upon her arrival on the battlefield, she commands like a deity, driving the Resistance Army into continuous retreat.\nSoldier B: Indeed, with her here, it seems this turmoil is finally coming to an end!\nGeneral: Advance! Give the Resistance the final blow.\n(Soldiers charge)\nStrategist: Finally, my hidden soldiers.\n(Pirates join the fray)\nWan Ye: You\u0026rsquo;re quite patient, Strategist.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader charge)\nSister Leader: I hope you can afford the price of hiring us, rebels.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader are about to confront the General)\nSoldier A: Not good, hurry and protect the General!\nSoldier B: We can\u0026rsquo;t extricate ourselves right now!\nSister Leader: General, let me behold your supreme martial skills.\nGeneral: Hmph, those who attempt to shatter eternity, show me your resolve.\n(The General unsheathes her sword and slashes forward)\n(Sister Leader retreats)\n(The General strikes again) [Thunderclap]\n(Flashback) Friend: There are always earthly creatures bold enough to face the might of thunderbolts.\n(Wan Ye steps forward)\nWan Ye: Sister Leader!\n(Wan Ye blocks the General\u0026rsquo;s strike)\nWan Ye: (with effort)\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: What expression would he have in that final moment?\nWan Ye: (gathers strength)\n(Wan Ye pushes the General\u0026rsquo;s sword away)\nGeneral: (startled inhale)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: That same expression once more.\n(The General slashes again, pushing Wan Ye back)\n(Wan Ye struggles to rise)\nWan Ye: (groans in pain)\n(Soldiers surround them)\nSoldier: General!\nGeneral: Stand aside for now.\n(Soldiers retreat, the General approaches Wan Ye)\nGeneral: I remember you. The day a samurai challenged me in a royal court duel, I exacted punishment, and you, stole his sword. I marked you as a top priority target, yet you managed to elude capture.\nWan Ye: Never meant to offend the General; there were extenuating circumstances.\nGeneral: Your friend has fallen beneath my blade. And you, having witnessed the outcome of defiance firsthand, why persist on this path?\nWan Ye: General, it\u0026rsquo;s not just me who\u0026rsquo;s resolute. Most likely, we merely wish to safeguard our swords, our desires.\nGeneral: Desires? Has the ancient samurai spirit not been lost, leaving only empty shells of swordsmanship techniques? In this chaotic era, isn\u0026rsquo;t a samurai wielding a sword only adding to the confusion? As a samurai from a noble house yourself, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you understand whether the true essence of the samurai code still exists within your family\u0026rsquo;s teachings, let alone wandering samurais who might not comprehend the ethics they should adhere to?\nWan Ye: The General has a point; the samurai code is barely discernible in my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings anymore. Through my travels and sparring with various samurais, I too have failed to find it.\nGeneral: Given this\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: Yet my dear friend, even in his vulnerability, sought opportunities for samurais. Despite the hardships, he chose to appeal alone. And the samurais, though begrudgingly, avoid unnecessary conflict and unite despite their differences.\nGeneral: So this is your perspective. What do you think samurai aspire to achieve with their swords?\nWan Ye: I believe it\u0026rsquo;s the unwavering commitment to and propagation of the samurai ethos. Each samurai household possesses its unique traditions, hence the vast and complex samurai community. Every martial art needs its own lineage, and among them, swordsmanship is something that must never be forsaken, which is why the samurai react against the Sword Hunt Decree.\nGeneral: Even so, the scattered factions of samurai, each adhering to their distinct ways of swordsmanship, present an inherently unstable element, conflicting with the eternal peace I strive for.\nWan Ye: However, if utilized properly, the power of the samurai can also serve to protect eternity. Earlier, my friend asked me,\nWan Ye \u0026amp; Friend: If one day our land is ravaged by disaster, and the people are no longer under the protection of the gods,\nFriend: What would you choose to do?\nWan Ye: When our land is beset by disaster, a samurai would unhesitatingly uphold the moral principles they cherish. Upholding benevolence, righteousness, propriety, sincerity, honor, loyalty, and bravery - samurai pursue benevolence, thus even in defiance, they ensure not to harm the innocent populace; they pursue righteousness and propriety, therefore even in rebellion, they establish alliances openly and honorably; they strive for loyalty and bravery, thus never harboring intentions to usurp power. Samurais do not disdain the world, nor do they incite chaos; they wield not weapons of slaughter, but swords that breathe life into the samurai spirit, ultimately guarding the samurai way. The samurai spirit is not lost; rather, it lies dormant in the peaceful passage of generations, ready to awaken as an unparalleled force when called upon.\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: In this conflict, am I the only one escalating it?\nWan Ye: General, why do you pursue eternity?\nGeneral: (deep breath) My sister once promised eternity to her subjects, where time flows but nothing changes. Yet, she who promised eternity could not sustain it herself, sacrificing her life in the previous anti-invasion war, exchanging it for the peace that prevails until today. Taking her place as the ruler, I inherit her promise; as the highest and most revered figure, I must offer my people a dream, named Eternity. (pause) Do you feel the bitter pain every time you grasp your sword? Though the power of swords and blades can crush countless enemies and overcome numerous challenges, there are things that cannot be cleaved by swords, even she, who protected her people with her sword, was but a fleeting dream, vanishing suddenly.\nWan Ye: There is no escaping pain. Dreams may be ephemeral, but they possess the brightest colors. Humans are not immortal, yet they possess boundless potential. Disasters lurk everywhere, sacrifices occur at any moment, but those who sacrifice themselves illuminate the entire sky with their burning passion, while those who continue to carry dreams will keep forging ahead, protecting our land.\nGeneral: Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re right; the conflict should not continue. (sighs) Policy changes require careful consideration. For now, maintain the unity of the samurai league. (loudly) Withdraw the troops!\n(The General departs)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: Although her physical existence may vanish like a dream, she has transformed into the divine cherry blossom in our hearts, and perhaps that is also a form of eternity.
