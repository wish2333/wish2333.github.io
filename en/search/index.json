Rural cultural squares, as essential components of novel public spaces, have yet to receive in-depth scrutiny regarding their close relationship with rural revitalization strategies and their roles in cultural and tourism communication. This paper takes rural cultural squares as its research subject and, through an investigation of Feng Village in Guangxi Province, reveals that rural cultural squares have gradually evolved into pivotal public gathering places and objects of cultural and tourism communication in Feng Village. They enrich the villagers\u0026rsquo; cultural lives and serve as a window for tourists to understand the culture of Feng Village. However, issues concerning power representation inherent in the development of cultural squares and their inadequacies in meeting the demands of cultural and tourism communication are also noteworthy.\nThis paper emphasizes the importance of employing strategies from three dimensions – memory empowerment, activity empowerment, and digital empowerment – to enhance the empowering function of cultural squares. By integrating these strategies, rural cultural squares can better contribute to rural revitalization efforts and optimize their role in the broader context of cultural and tourism dissemination.\nResearch Origins Rural public cultural spaces serve as the carrier domains where villagers engage in public life and constitute a crucial aspect of rural image construction. With the growing significance of rural cultural and tourism image creation and dissemination, the development and utilization of rural public cultural spaces face mounting challenges. Novel public cultural spaces emphasize the integration of elements such as aesthetic taste, humanistic care, regional characteristics, and social influence, forming a composite of both public and cultural spaces.[1] China\u0026rsquo;s 14th Five-Year Plan for Cultural Development calls for the establishment of such novel public cultural spaces, positioning rural public cultural space construction as a pivotal force driving rural revitalization. This not only aims at enhancing the rural image but also seeks to transmit national cultural confidence and traditional essence through the cultivation of cultural spaces.[2]\nThe Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance, in their opinions on promoting high-quality development of public cultural services, emphasize the innovative expansion of urban and rural public cultural spaces. This involves adapting measures to local conditions and activating excellent rural traditional culture through the construction of thematic spaces like cultural auditoriums, village opera stages, and intangible cultural heritage learning centers.[3] Rural cultural squares, as agglomerations of such thematic spaces, are a significant component in developing new types of rural public cultural spaces, carrying rich regional cultures and exerting considerable social influence.\nTourism and communication are inherently intertwined. Entering the 21st century, the Internet medium has widely and profoundly participated in cultural and tourism communication, rendering new characteristics in rural cultural and tourism dissemination within the information environment.[4] Both cultural squares and libraries, museums cannot detach themselves from the practices of communication under the Internet context, making cultural and tourism communication a fundamental backdrop for exploring the development of new public spaces.\nRural cultural squares represent the most important venues for villagers\u0026rsquo; cultural activities, constituting the most utilized and densely populated public cultural spaces. They connect traditional customs with local memories, vividly embodying the cultural features of the countryside and surrounding landscapes.[5] In the practice of cultural and tourism communication, rural squares act as windows showcasing the unique charm of Chinese villages and transmitting historical culture, thereby infusing new cultural connotations into national image building. Therefore, a deep understanding of the role cultural squares play in cultural and tourism communication can contribute to constructing a socially influential Chinese rural image and boosting the country\u0026rsquo;s cultural soft power.\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper endeavors to explore how cultural squares, as novel public spaces, can empower rural revitalization through cultural and tourism communication practices. What problems arise during this process? How do the driving and interactive roles in cultural tourism affect the construction and development of cultural squares? Have they given rise to new forms of cultural squares? Addressing these questions constitutes an attempt to elevate the empowering capabilities of cultural squares, innovate public cultural spaces, consolidate rural memories, and facilitate cultural and tourism communication.\nLiterature Review and Theoretical Framework Literature Review Over the past century since the emergence of sociology, scholars have ceaselessly engaged in the imagination of space. The concept of space has evolved towards more abstract notions of \u0026ldquo;social space\u0026rdquo; following in-depth discussions by French social thinkers. From Bourdieu\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;fields\u0026rdquo; to Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;production of space,\u0026rdquo; there is a shared emphasis on the structural nature of social space, while Simmel and subsequent researchers have approached it from the perspective of social interaction, focusing on the influence of social structures and situational interactions on individual behavior.[6] Research in spatial sociology, whether concerning the production-oriented or situational aspects of space, predominantly engages in \u0026ldquo;ontological inquiries\u0026rdquo; about space itself.\nSpatial Communication Studies The relationship between communication studies and spatial sociology was first deliberated within the urban ecology framework of the Chicago School. As Chinese communication theory enters a period of reflection and localization, academic practices concerning the connection between communication and rural development have also experienced shifts in direction and approach.[7] Presently, research in communication studies regarding rural public spaces primarily unfolds across three dimensions:\na. Examination of the Publicness of Rural Cultural Spaces and Their Relationship with Rural Governance. Ge Mingsi [8] advocates for actively promoting rural \u0026ldquo;new infrastructure,\u0026rdquo; enhancing rural societal mediatization levels, accelerating the cultural construction of county-level integrated media platforms, and innovating the generation of content. Tian Peng [9] argues that the construction of residential areas for rural residents requires breaking free from the constraints of institutional-benefit-driven dynamics and administrative-led practices, reconstructing the integration mechanisms of native societies, allowing farmers to rebuild regional publicness and transition smoothly into social communities. Song Chao et al. [10] address the publicness of rural spaces, proposing an \u0026ldquo;empowerment through media—reconstruction of publicness—restructuring governance\u0026rdquo; analytical framework, viewing county-level integrated media platforms as significant carriers of publicness.\nb. Exploration of the Image Construction of Rural Public Spaces. Wu Xinyan [11] proposes that the overall image construction of rural public cultural spaces should be guided by the value of cultural confidence, considering spiritual, place-based, and folk craftsmanship cultural spaces. Fu Ting et al. [12], through the study of public reading spaces, suggest that the brand development strategy for rural public spaces requires equal consideration of service demands from various audience groups and the strategic use of multiple channels to enhance brand influence.\nc. Focus on the Impact of Online Communication and New Media Development on Rural Public Cultural Spaces. Gu Dazhi et al. [13] argue that the impact of new media erodes fragile rural cultures, necessitating the use of rural cultural spaces for the reconstruction and revival of rural public cultural spaces. Ji Guangxu [14], analyzing青少年 offline social disembedding phenomena from the perspective of social affordances, finds that in the production process of rural public spaces, differences exist in the perceptions and practices among activity subjects, highlighting the need to address both the challenges and opportunities brought by the internet to rural public space formation.\nMoreover, spatial communication studies extend to some unique perspectives. Xie Taiping [15], comparing the innovation and diffusion of \u0026ldquo;rural book houses\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;village square dance,\u0026rdquo; discovers different communication effects due to varying spatial characteristics in rural public space cultural construction. Li Hongyan et al. [16], through research on participants in rural markets, find that embodied communication imbues tension between village community information and market community information. Despite extensive research, current studies on public space communication largely focus on macroscopic examinations, the roles of space in rural governance, and its function as a medium, with less attention devoted to studying the audiences within these spaces.\nStudies on Rural Cultural Squares Research on typical rural public spaces like cultural auditoriums, village opera stages, and museums is relatively mature. Rural cultural squares, as aggregators of various themes and vital components of new rural public cultural spaces, have increasingly become significant research subjects. Liu Mingtao [17] analyzes rural cultural squares using spatial sociology, suggesting that residents\u0026rsquo; voices and their participatory visions for space are being squeezed and require greater inclusion of resident users. Tian Jingli et al. [18] contend that rural squares should increase rural flavor and uniqueness, respecting the strong desires of villagers and reflecting their aspirations for a better life. Ren Hanchen [19], through the study of Huagu Deng culture in Fengtai County, Anhui Province, finds that rural cultural squares serve as an ideal vessel for continuing regional cultural spirit. Overall, research on rural cultural squares under the background of cultural tourism communication is still in its early stages, though planning practices abound, with a primary focus on landscape design and governance issues. Studies within the context of cultural tourism communication pay more attention to rural cultural identity and its transmission.\nThrough the review of existing literature, it has been observed that research in the fields of communication studies, spatial sociology, and rural public spaces such as cultural squares generally tends to center on \u0026ldquo;ontological explorations\u0026rdquo; of space, focusing primarily on the inherent properties and characteristics of these spaces themselves. However, there is a relative dearth of investigation into the intricate interplay between individuals, space, and communication processes. Consequently, this paper devotes particular attention to the driving forces and interactive logics behind the development and construction of cultural squares in the context of cultural tourism communication. It aims to delve into the empowering practice pathways that take into account feedback from the audience, thereby exploring the dynamic relationships between individuals, the spaces they inhabit, and the act of communication within these environments.\nTheoretical Framework The theoretical framework of this paper draws upon two main sources: (1) the \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; perspective in spatial sociology, and (2) the Innovation Diffusion Model.\nThe \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; perspective in spatial sociology is a conceptual framework developed by Chinese scholars, influenced by Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s theory of spatial production and Giddens\u0026rsquo; structuration theory in their exploration of the \u0026ldquo;action-structure\u0026rdquo; path in spatial research. At its core, this perspective emphasizes people\u0026rsquo;s practical behaviors and perceptual experiences within space. This viewpoint shifts the focus from conventional spatial structures and forms to actual usage and perception of space, emphasizing its practicality. While Lefebvre asserts that space is a product of social practice, the \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; approach highlights individuals\u0026rsquo; practical engagement and sensory experiences within space. Building on Giddens\u0026rsquo; structuration theory, which attends to the influence of social structures on individual actions, the \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; theory underscores subjective practices and experiences in space, introducing a stronger subjective dimension. It encompasses three aspects of practical analysis: 1) individuals\u0026rsquo; perception, utilization, and interaction with space; 2) interest groups participating in space governance based on their feelings and emotional investment in space; and 3) individuals\u0026rsquo; communication activities in networked spaces and related usage behaviors.[20]\nThis paper does not neglect the \u0026ldquo;action-structure\u0026rdquo; theoretical pathways formed by spatial practice and structuration theories, but rather employs them to analyze the status quo of rural cultural squares while using the \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; theory to examine the practices and experiences within these squares, providing a multifaceted consideration of the roles rural cultural squares play in cultural tourism communication.\nThe Innovation Diffusion Theory emerged in the early 1960s from sociologist Everett Rogers, focusing on explaining how new ideas, products, or practices spread throughout society and influence it. Its key concepts include innovation, adopters, communication channels, social systems, and temporal factors. The theory underscores the social nature of information diffusion and focuses on the adoption process of new practices.\nIn the broader context of rural revitalization and cultural tourism communication, the Innovation Diffusion Theory provides a profound and comprehensive perspective for analyzing rural cultural squares. This paper will employ the Innovation Diffusion Theory to analyze the functions and cultural connotations of cultural squares, identify the individuals or organizations adopting and embracing their innovations, investigate the relationship between cultural square\u0026rsquo;s cultural tourism communication, social networks, and cultural inheritance, and explore the most effective pathways for cultural squares in cultural tourism communication.\nSpatial sociology emphasizes the practicality and subjective experience of social space, whereas communication studies focus on information transmission and social interaction. Within rural squares, these two disciplines intertwine. Through the \u0026ldquo;use-experience\u0026rdquo; theory in spatial sociology, we can deeply analyze individual behavior, perception, and interaction within the square, revealing the mutual shaping of space and social interaction. Under a communication studies lens, we can understand how squares become sites for information transmission, guiding the diffusion of cultural elements. The concepts from spatial sociology offer fresh insights for interpreting the social nature of squares, enabling us to comprehend more fully the multidimensional impacts of rural squares in cultural tourism communication, including social interaction, cultural experiences, and information dissemination.\n本文为完全由本人独立创作于2024年1月10日，请勿侵权。本文为英文译文，中文原文、附表、参考文献等见附件PDF\n","date":"2024-01-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2024/tourism-communication/img1_hub25ddc7fa3a3735c32db5cb822815842_3977171_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2024/tourism-communication/","title":"Exploring Practice Paths for Cultural Square Empowerment in Rural Revitalization Under the Context of Cultural and Tourism Communication--An Investigation Based on Feng Village, a National Key Rural Tourism Site in Guangxi, China"},{"content":"Abstract Through an urban sociological lens, this investigation will delve deeply into the unequal distribution and utilization of social spaces among different areas, neighborhoods, or specific locales within the Dingfuzhuang area of Chaoyang District, Beijing. We aim to identify the concrete manifestations of such inequalities within the particular community, encompassing aspects such as the distribution of infrastructure, allocation of public service facilities, and usage patterns of residential public spaces.\nResearch Background Social Space Social space is a central concept in urban sociology, profoundly developed and elucidated by French scholars such as Bourdieu and Lefebvre. Distinct from other concepts like social structure, social systems, and social networks, social space focuses on actors, their positions, and the relationships between them. It underscores the structural nature of social space and maintains close ties with Marxist theory.\nUrban ecology perspectives offer a different understanding of social space, seeing it as the setting where social interaction occurs, emphasizing the influence of social structures on individual behavior. Simmel views social space as having cohesiveness, conscious boundaries, and stresses the internal relations within space; for him, social distance transcends physical proximity, incorporating emotional dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Goffman further investigates how individuals organize their surrounding space through his work Behavior in public places: notes on the social organization of gatherings.①\nIn summary, social space is a complex and multi-dimensional concept that encompasses individuals, locations, interactions, and power dynamics. Diverse schools of thought and scholars interpret social space differently, providing rich perspectives for understanding urban social life.\nStudies on Social Space Previous studies have approached social space in various ways:\nThe multifaceted research paths on social space: Different scholars have proposed numerous research avenues, including community-based spatial sociology, situational spatial sociology, distributive spatial sociology, and productive spatial sociology. This diversity reflects the varied interests in different aspects and dimensions of social space.② The practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of space play pivotal roles across these diverse research paths.③\nTransformation and dilemmas of public space: Research on public space emphasizes its evolution and the challenges it faces. Public space has conceptual, social, and material attributes in social life. In the conduit society model, urban public spaces are categorized into regulatory and nodal types, serving as critical domains for power and capital regulation.④ Although public space loses its integrative functions over time and tends toward specialization in modern society, it retains the potential to connect disparate groups and carries real social space significance despite being shaped by power and capital dynamics.\nSocial space in the Chinese context: Within the Chinese context, social space research covers economic, political, and social changes in urban spaces. Institutional transformation, economic restructuring, and social structure changes jointly shape the evolution of urban spaces. This includes shifts in the role of urban governments, economically-driven spatial restructuring, and the balancing of commercial and civic values. Studies on urban space also highlight homogenization and instability, pointing to the socioeconomic dynamics in spatial transformations.⑤\nExploring these three research paths provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in social space research, contributing to the construction of a richer and more profound theoretical framework for social space.\nAfter a deep comprehension of social space theories and their research trajectories, we adopt an integrated research perspective. Social space is both a macroscopic view of actors, their positions, and structural relations between them, and a microscopic view of individual social interaction contexts.\nDrawing upon proximity and accessibility, we select Dingfuzhuang community in Chaoyang District, Beijing, for in-depth inquiry. Focusing on the unequal distribution and use of social space among different regions, neighborhoods, or specific sites, we aim to understand the concrete manifestations of these inequalities within the local community, such as the distribution of public service spaces, the use of residential public spaces, and the planning and development of industrial spaces. Not only concentrating on the practicality, sociability, human-centricity, and historicity of social space, but also considering the specific social and economic structures within the Chinese context, our goal is to accurately analyze the impact of social space inequality on residents\u0026rsquo; lives and social interactions.\nResearch Methods and Findings Literature Review Providing an Overview Spatial Concentration: From the perspectives of both Chaoyang District and Dingfuzhuang, public service spaces, residential public spaces, and industrial spaces all exhibit characteristics of concentration. This concentration phenomenon may lead to certain communities or areas enjoying a greater abundance of resources and services, while other regions relatively lack these amenities. Such unequal distribution of resources could potentially give rise to social inequality issues, impacting residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions.\nGreen Spaces in Suburbs: Similarly, green spaces are also concentrated in suburban locations with limited accessibility, which hinders their use by residents. The centralized distribution of suburban green spaces might result in some residents having difficulty accessing natural environments conveniently, thereby influencing their quality of life and social engagement.\nHorizontal Expansion, Vertical Decline: Dingfuzhuang is situated along the horizontal axis of Beijing, and within the urban planning of Chaoyang District, it is incorporated into the CBD-Dingfuzhuang Media and Cultural Industry Belt. This horizontal development axis has given rise to a pattern where social space in Dingfuzhuang experiences robust horizontal expansion but relative vertical decline. In this context, the horizontal dimension primarily represents the growth of industries and work flow, whereas the vertical dimension symbolizes human life trajectories and movement patterns. The emphasis on the horizontal aspect reflects, to a certain extent, the underemphasis on human-centric livability factors within this area.\nThus, we proceeded with field research and questionnaire surveys to delve deeper into the underlying situations and causes.\nField Research Reveals Nuanced Details Site Selection: In our field research, we focused extensively on areas found in the literature review to have high concentrations of public service spaces. Ultimately, we selected two representative residential communities, namely Dahuangzhuang Nanli and Dingfu Home, as well as the DREAM2049 International Cultural and Creative Industry Park and the Wando Technology \u0026amp; Culture Industry Park for in-depth investigation.\nAbsence of Youth in Public Spaces? Research Log: During the evening at the cultural square, young people seemed conspicuously absent; instead, seniors were predominantly engaged in activities such as playing cards, chess, and even using ping-pong tables for card games despite the heavy snow from the previous day. Fitness facilities remained largely unused. Strikingly, the crowd was mostly male, with only a few women interspersed among groups of men. One elderly couple was seen accompanying two children, with no other children present. The open space at Dahuangzhuang Nanli\u0026rsquo;s cultural square, closely connected to nearby residential neighborhoods, revealed a notable absence of young people, particularly those from the adjacent Communication University-affiliated secondary school. The commercial offerings in Jinyinbao Life further suggested that the place caters mainly to an older demographic. This asymmetry between proximity to youth congregation points and their lack of presence here prompted us to investigate this phenomenon further.\nOversized Residential Areas with Overconcentrated Commercial Spaces Research Log: Dingfu Estate, built near a subway station, inevitably exhibits Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)-related issues, most notably the clustering of commercial areas around the subway entrances. With its large scale, residents living far from the subway stations might find it challenging to fully access the related conveniences. Dingfu Home covers a vast area, and ground-level shops are densely distributed near subway exits or shared intersections, often leaving residents with just one or two shopping districts within walking distance, easily missed if they take the wrong route.\nCompared to Dahuangzhuang Nanli, Dingfu Home is newer and hosts more renters and young people. We observed that the residential estates here are enormous yet poorly interconnected. Consequently, social connections among residents in Dingfu Home are sparse. Furthermore, the overconcentration of businesses around the subway stations affects residents\u0026rsquo; ability to enjoy the full benefits of nearby commercial zones.\nSevere Imbalance in Road Traffic Pressure Research Log: Walking northwards through Dingfu Home South and then North, I noted that during the morning rush hour at around 9 am, the traffic on Chaoyang Road was bustling and noisy. However, upon diverting onto any perpendicular (north-south, or longitudinal) road, one would be surprised by the wide and sparsely occupied four-lane roads (such as Sanjianfang Middle Road). It raises the question of why such broad roads exist when the traffic demand seems lower.\nThe difference in traffic volume between longitudinal and transverse roads in the vicinity of Dingfu Home is striking. While transverse roads are packed with vehicles during peak hours, longitudinal roads are eerily quiet with only a few cars passing leisurely. This disparity highlights another issue: the government\u0026rsquo;s attention to transverse road construction seems to overshadow maintenance and improvement of longitudinal roads. This neglect leads to rampant illegal parking, piled-up snow along the roadside, and cyclists forced to navigate close to the center of these roads—a worrying situation for the \u0026rsquo;last mile\u0026rsquo; connectivity to homes. This imbalance calls into question whether the infrastructure truly prioritizes people\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nNotable \u0026ldquo;Tidal Ghost Town\u0026rdquo; Phenomenon Inside Industrial Parks Research Log: The overall impression of the industrial parks was that they felt desolate and unkempt, akin to a construction site hastily converted into a park with a few buildings erected. The parks had minimal landscaping, featuring merely a sparse line of pine trees every several meters. There were no outdoor recreational areas provided for employees within the parks, such as for sports, rest, or dining. The nearest park required a walk of over 40 minutes, rendering it practically inaccessible during working hours. The construction of parks seemed to prioritize residential areas, while the developers of the industrial parks failed to invest adequately in greening efforts. The employee experience, mental and physical health, and the provision of comfortable working environments appear to have been overlooked by society.\nThroughout Chaoyang District, numerous cultural and creative industry parks occupy significant urban space. Yet, these parks, which serve as new locales for Beijing\u0026rsquo;s cultural industry growth, suffer from a pronounced \u0026ldquo;tidal ghost town\u0026rdquo; phenomenon. Specifically, after sunset and as workers leave for home, these parks become deserted and inactive, with expansive squares left unused. As these parks take up considerable urban land, the question arises whether there are more rational strategies for spatial utilization that can ensure round-the-clock functionality and vibrancy.\nEmpirical Research Measuring Resident Perceptions Building upon the observations and details discovered in our field research, we further conducted empirical research utilizing questionnaires and in-depth interviews to gauge residents\u0026rsquo; actual perceptions. We distributed questionnaires to college students in Beijing, collecting 101 valid responses and three sets of in-depth interview materials. Additionally, we administered questionnaires to general Beijing residents, obtaining 524 valid responses. We will explore the resident perceptions reflected in the questionnaires through descriptive statistics.\nYoung People Are Not Absent, But Misaligned Our questionnaire data revealed that young people indeed frequent parks and malls. However, why are they scarcely seen in our observations at Dahuangzhuang Nanli? The reality is that residential public spaces and industrial zones often do not align with the preferences of younger demographics. An interviewee pointed out, \u0026ldquo;It feels like the nearby parks are for seniors; they don\u0026rsquo;t suit us.\u0026rdquo; This indicates that young people are not absent from the social space in Dingfuzhuang; rather, they are misaligned with the older population. While different groups having varied preferences is normal, our concern lies in the fact that across the three surveyed locations, covering a substantial area, various public spaces catering to diverse populations are not evenly distributed. This observation substantiates the conclusion regarding spatial concentration, highlighting an aspect requiring attention during urban planning.\nStrong Resident Perception of Social Space We note that social spaces, as interactive venues, are strongly perceived among residents. Parks and commercial plazas are frequently visited spaces, and notably, the subway system emerges as a frequented scene, reflecting alongside the deficiency in longitudinal transportation lines in Dingfuzhuang, an imbalance in the development of horizontal and vertical space flows in residents\u0026rsquo; lives.\nSummary This paper analyzes the current state of social space in Dingfuzhuang, Chaoyang District, Beijing, from a theoretical perspective of social space, uncovering issues such as uneven distribution of public service spaces, oversized residential areas coupled with overly concentrated commercial facilities, extreme and imbalanced traffic pressures, and the \u0026ldquo;tide-empty city\u0026rdquo; phenomenon within industrial parks. These problems not only affect residents\u0026rsquo; quality of life and social interactions but also reflect irrationalities and unsustainability in urban planning and development.\nTo improve the social space in Dingfuzhuang and enhance its livability and vitality, we propose the following recommendations:\nIncrease the supply and distribution of public service spaces, especially within residential areas and surrounding industrial parks, providing more parks, libraries, museums, sports venues, etc., catering to the needs of residents across age groups and interests, fostering community cohesion and accumulation of social capital.\nAdjust the scale and structure of residential areas, reducing enclosed compounds and increasing open blocks to strengthen inter-residential connectivity and interaction, improving convenience and safety for residents\u0026rsquo; travel, and creating more humanistic and diversified living environments.\nBalance traffic pressure and distribution, optimizing the design and management of both horizontal and vertical roads, enhancing road usage efficiency and safety, promoting public transport and non-motorized vehicle use, reducing private car usage and parking, decreasing traffic congestion and pollution, and elevating the city\u0026rsquo;s greenness and aesthetic appeal.\nActivate the internal space utilization of industrial parks, adding greenery and leisure spaces within them, offering more cultural and creative activities to attract more young people and entrepreneurs, creating vibrant and innovative industrial parks, facilitating industrial transformation and upgrading, and strengthening the city\u0026rsquo;s competitiveness and influence.\nThrough these recommendations, we aim to bring about improvements and development to the social space in Dingfuzhuang, ultimately creating a better future for both its residents and the city itself.\nReferences 社会空间从齐美尔到戈夫曼，刘思达，2023 迈向什么样的空间社会学——城市社会学对象的四种路径与反思，营立成，2019 空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究，宗海勇，2018 秩序、利润与日常生活——公共空间生产及其困境，杨宇振，2018 社会空间和社会变迁——转型期城市研究的“社会—空间”转向，钟晓华，2013 ","date":"2023-12-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/img5_hu94a8f2158ebab76b13567173d6432ef9_4465643_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://wish2333.github.io/en/2023/social-spatial-inequality-within-dingfuzhuang/","title":"Social Spatial Inequality within The Dingfuzhuang Community"},{"content":"理解城市-结课作业 2023-10-28选题：黄淼森 社会空间不平等问题\n参考文献\nzhihu/p/452072791 zhihu/p/106501422 sohu/a/482049556_121124003 fjyl/file_no=20200910 douban.com/review/14200117/ 选题报告\n在报告中，将关注的主题定为“身边的社区存在的社会空间不平等现象”。这着眼于城市社会学的视角，分析社区内不同区域、地段或特定场所之间的社会空间分配和利用不平等。通过案例分析，将探究社会空间不平等现象的具体表现，比如不同社区内部的基础设施分布、公共服务设施的不均匀分配、居民的社会地位差异等。可选取多个案例展示在特定社区内部的社会空间不平等，强调特定地区资源分配和利用的差异，以及这些差异对居民生活和社会互动产生的影响。这样的报告旨在深入挖掘城市中社会空间不平等现象，强调社会公平和可持续发展的重要性，同时提出可能的改善措施以促进更公正、更平等的社会空间分配。 2023-10-30：选题报告撰写 规划资料\nbjchy/affair/announcement/fb_14 beijing.gov.cn/zhengce/gfxwj 选题报告 定福庄社区内存在的社会空间不平等现象\n我们将通过城市社会学的视角，深入探究北京市朝阳区定福庄内不同区域、地段或特定场所之间的社会空间分配和利用不平等现象。我们将寻求了解这些不平等现象在特定社区内的具体表现，如基础设施分布、公共服务设施的分配以及居民区公共空间的使用情况。本研究将采用案例分析方法，选取多个具体案例作为研究对象，通过实地调研、数据收集等手段，用定性的方式探索城市社区内的社会空间不平等情况，着重分析这些差异对居民生活和社会互动的影响。我们强调社会公平和可持续发展的重要性，并尝试提出可能的改善措施。\n社会空间资料 张一兵|社会空间的关系性与历史性\n列斐伏尔社会空间论的具体讨论域，同样是在讨论资本主义生产方式，但是他关心的问题是这一生产方式在实际社会空间中发生的历史过程。在他看来，资本主义生产方式的出现，在交通运输上首先利用了现存空间中的条件，原先客观环境中已经存在的河流和大海，人们的步行、骑马、骑自行车的活动都是已经发生在传统生产方式中的客观条件和主体实践，除此之外，资本主义新型的生产方式必须拥有自己新型的交通空间，这种新型空间建构是随着资本主义工业生产的需要，建设了铁路、高速公路和航空港。 “对空间的渗透已经在实现制度渗透获得霸权” 也由此，列斐伏尔指认说，他所重构的社会空间是“某种‘行走在大地上’（sur le terrain）的现实（réalisation），即在某种被生产出的社会空间（espace social produit）之中的现实，是社会关系的生产和再生产（rapports sociaux de production et de reproduction） 纪要|社会空间:从齐美尔到戈夫曼- 北京大学社会学系 社会空间 社会空间具有三个构成要件：行为主体（actors），位置（positions），以及二者之间的联结关系 社会空间的概念与其他常见概念相区别——社会结构关注社会生活的结构和形状，而非行为主体的自主性；社会系统关注行为主体的功能和角色，而非空间位置；社会网络关注行为主体之间的纽带，而非行为主体和位置之间的联结。 区别于法国学者布迪厄 (Pierre Bourdieu) 和列斐伏尔 (Henri Lefebvre) 的论述（两人都受到马克思主义理论的深刻影响，而且强调社会空间的结构性。），从齐美尔到戈夫曼的这一脉传统却并非是结构性的，而是以社会互动为基础，有着他们独特的关注与品味。 齐美尔的“社会空间” 社会空间存在有意识的边界，空间具有 “内聚性”(internally cohesive)。 因而齐美尔较少考虑空间的外部，或者只是将其作为环境来对待。 社会距离是存在时空性的。时间和空间意义上的社会距离指的并不是两点之间的一个固定距离，往往涉及人们之间的​情感关系​。空间距离对情感可能产生不同效果。两个人之间的空间距离越近，既可能使感情更加强烈，也可能带来很强的压迫性。社会距离同物理距离之间不可分割，与人的情感关系也是如此。 在社会空间之中，还存在一种有盲点的情形，并非每个社会空间的位置都有人占领，这就产生了齐美尔所谓的 “虚无空间”（empty space）。在芝加哥学派的理论中，只有当存在虚无空间之时，才会有人群去竞争和抢占，空间的流动性也由此产生。这一点可谓齐美尔与芝加哥学派的社会空间理论与法国理论的重要区别之一。 芝加哥学派的“社会空间” 他在一张同心圆图上将芝加哥分为由中心到边缘的各个不同区域，去研究处于不同位置上的不同群体之间如何互动，不同族裔在城市空间之中如何流动，而非完全关注城市的结构性特征。这是当代城市社会学研究中时常忽略的一个问题。 芝加哥学派认为社会互动有四种基本形态：竞争（competition）、冲突（conflict）、顺应（accommodation）、同化（assimilation）。此外还有一种经常被后来的研究忽略的形态——孤立（isolation） ，它同齐美尔的虚无空间有所关联，因为当两个人或两个群体之间的空间是虚无空间时，就会产生孤立。 既然社会空间存在边界，就会有入侵的现象，入侵者和空间区位原来的占据者之间产生互动，从而出现各个人群的适应现象。帕克、伯吉斯、麦肯齐 (Roderick D. McKenzie) 等第一代芝加哥学派的社会学家认为，人类社会的诸多文化特征，都是在入侵与适应的过程之中产生的。 戈夫曼的社会空间理论 《精神病院》(Asylums) 、《公共空间的关系》(Relations in Public)\n《精神病院》一书中，提出了 “全控机构”(total institution) 这一经典概念，精神病院、监狱、军队、寄宿学校等全控机构都把人同外界隔离开来，让其原本的自我消亡，在机构中形成新的训练和秩序。~值得注意的是，戈夫曼的这一概念同芝加哥学派将城市作为一个生态系统进行研究，以及齐美尔关于框架和边界的论述，具有一个共同点，也就是都将研究者所关注的社会空间之外的东西隔离出去，不予考虑，或者只作为外部环境来考虑。~\n《公共空间的关系》中《自我的领地》(The Territories of the Self) 一文从自我出发，探查自我周边的空间是如何组织的。\n“领地” 有三种类型：固定的（fixed）、情境化的（situational）、自我中心的（egocentric）\n由此，他区分了八种个人领地——个人空间 (personal space)，即属于个人的专属空间；落脚之处 (the stall)，比如公共空间一些舒适的椅子、电话亭等暂时性的空间；用途空间 (use space)，比如被 “占用” 的谈话人之间的视线、运动员使用器械的空间；次序 (the turn)，即通过先来后到等次序确定的空间；外套 (the sheath)，比如遮挡皮肤的衣服或一把伞；占有领地 (possessional territory)，比如用外衣、帽子、手包等个人物品所占有的空间；信息禁区 (information preserve) 以及谈话禁区 (conversational preserve)，比如某一微信群内信息共享、自由谈话，但不能随意扩展到外面的空间。可以看出，戈夫曼的这个分类是将物理空间与社会空间混在一起论述的。 “标记”(markers) 与 “侵犯”(encroachment)的概念。对于领地的占有需要标记，通常是用一个私人物品放在某处，形成行为主体和位置之间的关系。\n侵犯也有不同的种类，一种是进入他人的领地，另一种则是放弃个人的领地，比如在排队过程中突然走掉，也是对次序的侵犯。 选题修改方向 个人\n分商业区域、公园区域、政宣区域

芝加哥学派城市生态学将“空间区位布局简化为社会世界复杂度”的城市生态学，区位、位置、流动性等概念被用来测量、描述和最终解释社会分层现象。 到60、70年代，以列斐伏尔为代表的新马克思主义城市社会学重新引入社会再生产、资本循环等概念，将空间作为重要的社会资源及力量，城市再生产由空间中的生产（productioninspace）转向了空间本身的生产（productionofspace）。 后现代地理学家索贾（EdwardSoja）继而将社会空间的意涵进一步深化，提出“空间性”（spatiality）概念，使之成为与“历史性、“社会性”并置的社会分析维度。 继一系列空间的价值维度和理论范式维度方面的学术努力之后，马克·戈特迪纳提出了更具操作性的社会空间视角（sociospatialperspective）他从以上理论中取精华，又避免了传统空间生态学和新马克思主义空间理论两者的简化论特征，试图将阶级、教育、权力、性别、种族等更多因素以一种整合的观点纳入城市空间的分析中 中国语境的社会空间 体制转型： 城市空间的改造并不是列斐伏尔意义上的空间生产；从生产导向的城市计划经济向服务消费导向全球市场经济转变的生产方式，需要生产出不同于以往的新空间，故此产业空间、居住空间和消费空间都发生了空间位置与形态上的巨大变化。城市空间的变迁背后不仅是资本累积的逻辑，也体现了政治控制与意识形态的逻辑。关于具体的中国城市空间生产机制的讨论， 多集中于城市政府角色的转变。 经济结构变迁： 城市空间结构的演化呈现出越来越强的经济利益驱动性和利益冲突特征。城市空间生产已成为当代中国建构社会生活世界的根本生产方式之一。与其他商品一样，这样的资本循环引发了空间的“同质化”，但由于空间不同于其他商品，是不可再生的稀缺资源，因此所谓新空间的生产不过是对旧空间的重复破坏以获取空间的交换价值，从而导致了空间的“不稳定性”。 社会结构变迁： 政府与市场主导的匀质、抽象的空间生产将原先多元、差异的日常生活世界推至边缘，城市空间的商业价值（占有）和市民价值（使用）敦轻敦重的问题浮出水面。如，快速城市化所导致的城乡格局变化和经济全球化所带来的产业空间重构致使大批城市新移民和市民化的农民的出现。 社会空间的研究转向 城市空间的社会性： 揭示自然、物质空间形态背后的动态政治、社会、文化意涵。观察资本在空间上的重新配置、劳动力流\n动、城市扩张、内城衰落等 城市社会的空间性： 物化的空间现象成为理解城市转型和社会变迁的具体镜像。政治经济制度、社会生产关系、个人家庭生活等无不具有空间性。体现在：资本生产与消费、国家-社会关系、符号和意义的系统、生活体验与身份认同

社会空间的多元研究路径： 在研究社会空间的路径中，不同学者提出了多种研究途径。这包括社区的空间社会学、情境的空间社会学、分配的空间社会学以及生产的空间社会学。这种多元化的路径反映了对社会空间不同层面和维度的研究兴趣。（迈向什么样的空间社会学——城市社会学对象的四种路径与反思，营立成，2019）其中，空间的实践性、社会性、人本性和历史性在不同研究路径中都起到了关键作用。（空间社会学视阈下城乡空间关系演进研究，宗海勇，2018） 公共空间的转变与困境： 关于公共空间的研究强调了其演变过程和面临的困境。公共空间在社会生活中具有观念、社会和物质的三种属性。在管道社会模型中，城市公共空间分为管束型和节点型，成为权力与资本调节的关键领域。（秩序、利润与日常生活——公共空间生产及其困境，杨宇振，2018）公共空间在历史过程中失去了整合性的功能特性，在现代社会中不断趋于专门化，但仍具有建立、粘结异化人群间沟通的潜力。公共空间的运动方向与内容虽然受到权力与资本的切割和形塑，但仍可能通过生产反异化、反规训的可能性，具有社会空间的实际意义。 中国语境下的社会空间： 在中国语境下，社会空间研究涵盖了城市空间的经济、政治和社会变迁。体制转型、经济结构变迁和社会结构变迁共同塑造了城市空间的演变。这包括城市政府角色的转变、经济利益导向的空间重构、商业价值与市民价值的权衡问题。对城市空间的研究还强调了空间的“同质化”和“不稳定性”，指向了空间变革中的社会经济动态。（社会空间和社会变迁——转型期城市研究的“社会—空间”转向，钟晓华，2013） 通过对这三个方面的研究路径的探究，我们能够更全面地理解社会空间的研究动态，有助于构建一个更丰富、深入的社会空间理论体系。 总结 在深刻理解社会空间理论及其研究路径后，我们将采用一种整合性的研究视角展开调查。社会空间既是宏观视角下行为主体、位置和它们之间的结构性关系，也是微观视角下个体的社会互动情境。 依据接近性和可获得性，我们选定了北京市朝阳区定福庄进行深入探究，关注不同区域、地段或特定场所之间的社会空间分配和利用不平等现象，了解这些不平等现象在特定社区内的具体表现，如基础设施分布、公共服务设施的分配以及居民区公共空间的使用情况。不仅聚焦于社会空间的实践性、社会性、人本性和历史性，还关注中国语境下特定的社会、经济结构关系，以求更准确地分析社会空间不公平对居民生活和社会互动的影响。

文献调查描绘整体 空间集中化 附图：朝阳区（设施图）+定福庄（设施图、自画调研商业区图） 无论从朝阳区还是从定福庄的角度出发，公共服务空间、居民区公共空间以及产业空间均呈现出集中化的特征。这种集中化现象可能导致某些社区或区域享有更多的资源和服务，而其他地区则相对欠缺。这种不均衡的资源分配可能引发社会不平等问题，影响居民的生活品质和社会互动。 绿地在郊区 附图：朝阳区（区划图）+定福庄（平面图） 绿地分布同样是集中化地分布的，同时位于郊区，这种低可达的特征对于居民的享用造成了阻碍。文献中提到的《抵抗孤独···》也强调了郊区绿地在城市规划中的位置，并讨论了其对社区居民的影响。这种郊区绿地的集中分布可能导致一些居民无法方便地享受到自然环境，从而影响其生活质量和社交互动。 横向的发展，纵向的式微 附图：朝阳区（景观图、设施图）+定福庄（交通图）\n位于北京市的横向中轴线上，定福庄的发展不可避免地存在横向的导向。然而，这种横向发展正反映了一些社会空间的不平等。\n从城市生态学的同心圆概念的批判入手，我们可以观察到在横向发展中，某些社区可能更受重视，而纵向却显得相对缺乏关注。这不仅在空间上表现为资源和服务的不均衡分布，同时也体现在城市规划的倾向性，可能导致一些区域的社会经济发展不尽如人意。 从空间的生产角度看不合理的流动：交通没有纵向的分布（居民通行的流向），而只分布在横向（工作通行）。这表明城市往往被视为一个白天工作、晚上离开的地方，而居民的社会互动的可能性相对较低。这种横向导向的城市规划可能加剧了社会空间中的不平等，限制了居民的活动空间和社交范围，影响了社会互动的多样性和深度。 实地调研发现细节 在实地调研中，我们集中在文献调查中发现的公共服务空间较为集中的区域【附图】展开了广泛的观察，在以下较为具有代表性的场景中最终选取了大黄庄南里、定福家园两个居民区以及DREAM2049国际文创产业园进行深入调研。\n大黄庄南里情况 文化广场、早市、金宝生活\n“傍晚时分来到文化广场，这里年轻人似乎已经绝迹，都是一些大爷大妈在玩。尽管昨天下了大雪，但这里打牌，下象棋，打乒乓球的人（好吧不是打乒乓球，是在乒乓球桌上打牌）依然非常多。一般的健身设施没什么人用。而且不知道什么原因，在这里活动的老年人以男性为主，能看到成群的男性中夹杂着零星的女性。除了一对老年夫妇带着两个小孩玩，此外没有小孩出没。作为一个文化广场，在社区的大门附近可能使得这个地方更像是社区的一部分，因此年轻人很少会进去参与活动。”\n“早市是一个具有时效性的场所，所以在傍晚时分来的时候，里面没有什么流动商贩。但那些固定的商家都还在摆，有开门的也有关门的，无论如何都比较冷清，偶尔有成对的老年夫妇或者是大爷经过看一看。金宝生活一层以中老年人为主，但也开始出现了不少年轻人；到了二层年轻人开始居多，而且也出现了小朋友。整体性别比比较均衡。”\n【年轻人的缺席】文化广场作为一个开放的场所，与附近小区居民之间存在密切的联系。然而，值得注意的是，尽管社区紧邻传媒大学附属中学，却几乎看不到年轻人在这个场所出现，这是一个引人关注的现象。金宝生活中商品的明显趋势（包括衣物款式和商品摆放等）也反映了这个地方的受众主要是年龄较大的人群。我们需要探讨的是，是什么原因导致了附近年轻人在这个区域的相对缺席？\n【短暂的活动时间】在大黄庄早市中，出现的油条“买十送一”等促销情况表明其受众并非独立个体，而是那些承担家庭或团队部分生活责任的人。这些人的聚集是否反映了在这个的家庭成员或团队成员相对较少，是一个值得思考的问题。\n定福家园情况 “我由南向北走，先经过定福家园南区再经过北区。首先的感受是，在朝阳路上早上九点交通很繁忙，在路旁走觉得很吵很心烦，但一旦从朝阳路上随便拐到一条南北（纵向）的路上，一下就会被宽敞又空旷的双向四车道三间房中路震惊到。明明交通需求没那么大，道路为什么修这么宽？\n随着逐渐向北走，接近社区，能感觉到明显能看到更多的老年人不过在接近地铁站的地方，又能看到都是赶着上班的年轻人。定福家园小区周边生活还算比较便利，最近的公园只有一公里不到，小区下面周围有超市（比较少），药房（比较少按摩店、健身房……但最令人心烦的是定福家园北里和南里之间夹着一条朝阳北路，车辆噪音很大，两侧路旁到处是停的电动车、共享单车，地上都是肮脏的积雪，被从机动车道上扫到道路两旁自行车道的地方，骑车路过要很小心。\n走到定福家园南里，最深刻的印象是旁边都是小区，但是小区和小区之间都用铁栅栏隔着，小区内部也看不到居民，感觉是一座鬼城。”\n【集中化的设施】作为一座新建于地铁口附近的小区，不可避免地存在一些与交通导向开发（Transit-Oriented Development，TOD）相关的问题，主要表现为商业区集中分布在地铁口周边。在小区规模较大的情况下，离地铁口较远的居民可能难以充分享受到相关便利。\n【纵向流动从不被利用到被忽视】\n【社会互动的缺失】我们注意到，在傍晚时分，很多人正在回家的路上，路边停放的车辆也不少，然而，公共空间中活跃的居民却寥寥可数。更令人注意的是，居民楼的公共空间甚至附近公园的照明也没有开启。这是否意味着社会互动的缺失呢？\n这种现象可能表明，尽管小区居民在日常生活中有着密切的交往，但在公共空间中的社交互动似乎较为有限。公共空间的未充分利用可能导致居民之间的社会互动机会减少。进一步的调查和分析将有助于更全面地理解这一现象，并提出改进居民社交体验的建议。\n居民区比较性分析 新建和旧建的客观情况\n居民的属性：常住民和租户 2 社会互动的区别\n流动性的不同表现\n1 2 从管线性观的社会空间来看，定福庄的公共空间无论是公园、广场，还是街道、商业区都没有能够形成节点或集束，也因此不能够调节社会存在的资本和权力问题。 文创产业园情况 “早上八点半开始逐渐有年轻人从南北门进入，走进大楼，但从南门进入的人更多，可能是因为南门旁边有很多小区。进入园区的人们神情凝重，步伐都很着急，可能因为今天上午风很大吧。园区内北门、南门附近建筑内饰比较高级，东西两侧都是砖砌平房，和大门旁边建筑格格不入。园区内食堂、餐厅、便利店比较齐全，甚至还有一个党政服务站。早上八点多园区内建筑里人不是很多，只有稀稀拉拉的几个人在一楼装修简陋的餐厅里边看手机边吃饭，感觉到他们很孤独。\n总体感觉产业园区内部很荒凉，脏兮兮的，好像一个建筑工地上随便铺了一点路，盖了几座楼就开始招商了。园区内绿化聊胜于无，只是每隔几米十几米种了一颗松树。除此之外，园区里面并没有给上班人们提供室外的休闲区域（运动、休息、就餐。。。）离园区最近的公园走路路程要20分钟以上，员工几乎没有办法在上班前后享受自然景观。感觉员工的个人体验、身心健康、能不能有一个舒适的上班环境，这些因素被忽视了”\n文创产业园本身是新建设的开放空间，其中通常包含可供人们使用的口袋公园空间。然而，实际上这些空间往往建设并不完全，即使建成也未得到人们的利用，甚至往往连灯光都未开启。这反映出工作地点的流动性。\n产业空间类比分析 东亿国际传媒产业园也存在类似的问题，当夜幕降临时，商厦和办公楼灯光熄灭，街上行人寥寥。尤其是商场前的广场大面积空置，这个原本规划为公共空间的区域却未能达到预期的使用效益，彰显了不仅是社会空间不平等问题的存在。 问卷测量居民感知 基本参与情况 参与发展情况 共建共治情况 总结：定福庄空间正义现状 结合上面的情况，总结几个要点 最后两三句话写结语

Through this investigation, the research aims to clarify how dimensions of perceived trust and perceived risk affect users\u0026rsquo; adoption willingness and to discern the roles played by information quality and hot level within the context of perceived trust.\nLiterature Review Research on User-Generated Content (UGC) User-Generated Content (UGC) emerged within the framework of Web 2.0, referring to user-driven participation in online platform development where they actively share and display their owned or created content. With the launch of video platform YouTube in 2005, the UGC model swiftly became a focal point in digital content evolution. Scholarly research on both theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of UGC has gradually burgeoned, leading to increased attention from various industries. New media platforms widely adopt the UGC model, relying on users for the integration and management of online resource information. [4]\nIn its early days, studies on UGC in new media primarily focused on video and blogging platforms. Sungmyung Huh [5] et al. employed the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory to investigate users\u0026rsquo; satisfaction and motivations behind using UGC platforms, asserting that self-expression constitutes a primary factor driving users to share and create videos on these platforms. Choi et al. [6] and Kim et al. [7], through their studies on video and blog platforms, posited that information interaction is a critical characteristic of UGC, emphasizing that user interfaces need to be designed adaptively to facilitate direct interaction between users and platform activities. Jae [8] also explored the effects of user control, synchronicity, and responsiveness on new media services and user information perception based on information interaction theories.\nAs mobile Internet became mainstream and the transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0 unfolded, the applicability of the \u0026ldquo;Uses and Gratifications\u0026rdquo; theory came under scrutiny. Ichimizu Hoshi [9] analyzed four case studies related to UGC and argued that this theory overlooks the trend of audiences transitioning into communicators in the new media era, attempting to break away from traditional media analysis frameworks and presenting a thought-provoking critical perspective. Overall, UGC research in new media mainly concentrates on three dimensions: platform users, interactive content, and new media technologies.\nHealth Information Adoption Studies In 1948, when the World Health Organization was founded, health was defined as \u0026ldquo;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u0026rdquo;\nBroadly speaking, health information encompasses all knowledge, news, data, facts, and materials related to health or illness. With the widespread adoption of the internet and mobile devices, the boundaries of health information dissemination have expanded, barriers have been broken down, and the conventional healthcare environment has progressively transformed into an online space for exchange and sharing. The health information discussed in this study within the context of new media platforms refers to web-based health information broadly relating to people\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental health, illnesses, nutrition, wellness, and can be roughly categorized into two types: health and medical information and health lifestyle information. [10] In recent years, a series of user information behaviors associated with health information, such as searching, acquisition, evaluation, application, and feedback, have increasingly attracted attention.\nHealth information adoption refers to the aggregate of all stages of behavior from the acquisition to the utilization of health information by individuals. [11] Closely related concepts include information reception, which typically implies passive receipt of information, whereas information adoption emphasizes the proactive agency of the individual. Current research on health information adoption largely falls into two categories: one focusing on causes, investigating which factors influence individuals\u0026rsquo; adoption of health information, and another concentrating on outcomes, exploring the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors.\nTraditional research on health information adoption tends to lean towards the causal aspect. The classic Information Adoption Model (IAM) was proposed by Sussman and Siegal, who built upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), suggesting that information adoption behavior is mediated by perceived usefulness, which in turn is influenced by the quality of arguments and the credibility of information sources. [12] Subsequent studies on the influencing factors of health information adoption mostly base their investigations on this model. For instance, Deng Shengli et al., drawing from TAM2 and IAM, incorporated perceived risk into a new model and conducted empirical research on health information adoption among users of Q\u0026amp;A platforms through questionnaire surveys. [13] Additionally, other scholars have delved into alternative factors potentially affecting health information adoption. Mo Xiuting et al., for example, examined the influence of health self-efficacy on health information adoption, finding it could serve as both a moderator and mediator variable. [14] Han Xiaoxiao et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on health information adoption among urban elderly revealed that individual social capital impacts their health information adoption. [15]\nIn recent times, the impact of health information adoption on individual health behaviors has also garnered interest from researchers. Some scholars suggest that examining the relationship between changes in health behaviors and health information adoption can provide informational support for modifying individual health behaviors, effectively promoting the change of unhealthy behaviors and enhancing personal health management capabilities. [16] [17] Therefore, research on health information adoption is currently in a stage where both causality and outcome are considered equally important. [18]\nDomestic Research on Health Information Adoption on UGC Platforms Regarding health information adoption on video-based UGC platforms, Peng Sihao et al. [19] studied the communication characteristics of health-related short videos on Douyin (TikTok) and the factors influencing user information behavior. They found that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively affect user information behavior while perceived risk negatively influences it. In the process of disseminating health-related short videos, information quality, source credibility, users\u0026rsquo; health concerns, and subjective norms all exert positive effects on information adoption. Li Li et al. [20] established a research framework for the adoption of health-related short video information based on the Information Adoption Theory and the Heuristic-Systematic Model. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), they analyzed the effect paths of antecedent variables on user health information adoption and employed Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to explore the combined effects of influential conditions on short video users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption. SEM results showed that content quality, platform reputation, and source credibility significantly impact perceived usefulness, which in turn affects users\u0026rsquo; adoption intention; content quality and perceived usefulness act as chain mediators in the effect of expressiveness on adoption intention. fsQCA analysis revealed that users\u0026rsquo; health information adoption decisions on short videos are jointly influenced by systematic and heuristic cues. Wang Xinglan et al. [21] constructed a theoretical model based on the Uses and Gratifications Theory, Health Belief Model, and Elaboration Likelihood Model, discovering that social gratification needs, learning gratification needs, perceived health threats, and perceived health expectations positively influence information adoption behavior, while argument quality, source credibility, and video appeal indirectly affect information adoption.\nIn the context of specialized online health communities, Liu Zhu [22] introduced perceived trust as a mediating variable and used information quality and information popularity derived from conformity theory to measure users\u0026rsquo; perceived trust. Perceived risk was used as an independent variable affecting both perceived trust and user information adoption, with health self-efficacy serving as another independent variable influencing user information adoption. Findings suggested that information quality (source reliability, information accuracy, and timeliness) significantly positively impacts perceived trust; information popularity significantly positively influences perceived trust; perceived risk significantly negatively affects perceived trust but does not significantly influence user information adoption; both perceived trust and health self-efficacy positively and significantly affect user information adoption. Perceived trust partially mediates the relationship between information quality and user information adoption, and fully mediates the relationship between information popularity and user information adoption. Zhu Yunqin et al. [23] utilized the Elaboration Likelihood Model combined with Information Need Theory to examine how high-level central processing (information quality) and low-level peripheral processing (carrier quality and source credibility) in an online health community environment affect users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness, subsequently influencing their information search behavior. Their findings indicated that for peripheral processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by source credibility and carrier quality; for central processing, users\u0026rsquo; perception of usefulness and emotional response are positively and significantly affected by information quality. Moreover, the relationships between information quality and source credibility with users\u0026rsquo; perception of information usefulness are negatively moderated by the motivational variable of information need.\nResearch Methodology Research Hypotheses Based on the theory of health self-efficacy, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nH1: Health self-efficacy among college students positively affects their health information adoption.\nConsidering that health information quality comprises aspects like accuracy and timeliness [33], and taking into account the strong emotional nature of content expression on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), this study adds information emotional intensity to the concept of information quality. Drawing from relevant theories of the Information Adoption Model, the following hypotheses are put forward:\nH2: The quality of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2a: The emotional intensity of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2b: The accuracy of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H2c: The timeliness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nDrawing from theories related to the Information Adoption Model and referencing Chou et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on source credibility, the following hypotheses are presented:\nH3: The credibility of health information sources on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3a: The credibility of health information providers on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H3b: The platform credibility of Xiaohongshu positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nGrounded in Social Influence Theory, the following hypotheses are advanced:\nH4: Social influence of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4a: User consensus on health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness. H4b: The popularity or information热度 of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences users\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness.\nConsistent with the Information Adoption Model, the final hypothesis is:\nH5: College students\u0026rsquo; perceived usefulness of health information on the Xiaohongshu platform positively influences their health information adoption.\nQuestionnaire Structure Design The survey questionnaire consists of two main sections: a Likert scale section and a section collecting basic information about the respondents. The Likert-scale portion is structured as a matrix with 3-6 items designed for each dimension based on the research model and hypotheses. The basic information section primarily gathers data on the gender, educational level, and major of the respondents.\nPast studies have shown that medical and social science majors exhibit relatively higher levels of media literacy when processing and accepting information, with no significant statistical differences observed among other majors. Consequently, this study targets college students from medical, social science, and other majors, administering the same standardized questionnaire across three independent surveys.\nThe research questionnaire is divided into three parts:\nIntroduction: This part outlines the purpose of the survey, assures confidentiality of responses, and expresses gratitude to the participants. It also defines the scope and definition of health information before filtering out participants who have browsed or read health information on Xiaohongshu, focusing primarily on those who have had exposure to such content. Core Content: This section contains the heart of the questionnaire, measuring five constructs within the research model through 37 measurement items: Health Self-Efficacy (5 items) Information Quality (10 items): Information Emotional Intensity (4 items) Information Accuracy (3 items) Information Timeliness (3 items) Source Credibility (7 items): Platform Credibility (3 items) Provider Credibility (4 items) Social Influence (6 items): User Consensus (2 items) Information Popularity (4 items) Perceived Usefulness (4 items) Health Information Adoption (5 items) All measurement items utilize a 5-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neutral, 4: agree, 5: strongly agree). Personal Information: This part collects demographic details, including gender, academic status, and specific field of study. Pilot Survey and Questionnaire Revision The pilot questionnaire consisted of 15 questions, including 11 Likert scale items and 4 personal information questions. A pilot survey was conducted among university students in Beijing, resulting in 123 questionnaires distributed and 73 valid responses, giving an effective return rate of 59.35%. Based on the pilot survey data analysis, several improvements were made:\nSince there was almost no correlation between the respondent\u0026rsquo;s school and their usage or adoption behaviors, the item asking about the \u0026ldquo;school attended\u0026rdquo; was removed. Instead, the \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; question was refined to provide clearer and more precise options. Some items in the Likert scale had low factor loadings or lacked specificity, indicating low effectiveness. Such invalid items were eliminated from the final questionnaire. The revised formal questionnaire comprised 11 matrix Likert scale sets and 3 basic information questions, with a reduction in the number of questions within the matrices and improved clarity and consistency in their phrasing and logical sequence.\nFormal Sampling Survey For the formal survey, three criteria were set for selecting participants: (1) they must have used the Xiaohongshu platform, (2) they must have a certain degree of interest in health information, and (3) they must be currently enrolled college students. Through snowball sampling, eligible participants were asked to recommend others who met these requirements.\nBased on 2021 data released by the Ministry of Education on the number of undergraduate students by discipline category, the ratio of students in the medical category to those in four other categories (law, education, management, and economics) was approximately 1:4. This ratio was approximated for the Beijing student population to ensure a consistent sample size ratio in the two comparative studies.\nThe formal survey began on June 19, 2023, and ended on June 25, 2023, lasting for seven days. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed, 281 were returned, and 174 were deemed valid, yielding an effective recovery rate of 61.92%.\nThe data analysis section is omitted here; please refer to the attachment for details.\nReferences(partially) [4] 范哲, 朱庆华, 赵宇翔.

Throughout the series, it featured both bizarre incidents that left viewers laughing and crying, as well as thrilling on-site arrests, showcasing both the stern and rigorous law enforcement procedures and heartwarming grassroots services. Behind the hustle and bustle, the guardians never rest; in recent years, documentaries focusing on law enforcement have increasingly attracted the younger generation. Today, let us take a step into these \u0026ldquo;outposts\u0026rdquo; that serve and protect the people, gaining an understanding of the most authentic front lines of police work.\nGuarding Liberation West The Guarding Liberation West series is a legal education documentary centered around the daily work of police officers in Changsha, Hunan Province. This documentary deeply showcases the routine tasks of urban police officers in the central business district of a metropolis, revealing the intricate interplay of law, reason, emotion, and reality within complex policing situations through activities such as police patrols, multi-departmental cooperation, suspect interrogations, and involvement in major cases. It portrays a vivid image of responsible, rational, and compassionate police officers, and disseminates relevant safety and legal knowledge to the public through various case stories. The featured police officers in the show have distinct characteristics, each with their own areas of expertise and endearing personalities, which constitutes one of the main attractions of Guarding Liberation West.\nThanks to the rich experience of Hunan TV in producing variety shows, and due to the everyday, relatable nature of the cases depicted in Guarding Liberation West, the program infuses a certain level of entertainment into the rigorous process of law enforcement, ensuring seriousness while also catering to viewers\u0026rsquo; preferences for amusement. In the bar and commercial districts, an abundance of civil disturbances resulting from alcohol consumption serve as a recurring thread throughout the three episodes. Incidents under the influence of alcohol can sometimes jeopardize public safety, create misunderstandings, appear absurdly comical, or lead to tragedies. The show captures life\u0026rsquo;s nuances vividly in minor incidents while maintaining strict rigor in significant matters, providing viewers with a delightful viewing experience.\nGuarding Liberation West is filled with wit, humor, and laugh-out-loud moments, telling stories of human life and its vicissitudes in the Liberation West area of Changsha, portraying the spirit, unique personalities, and selfless dedication of grassroots police officers in the new era. While conducting serious legal education, it also offers a sense of relaxation and enjoyment, making it an essential companion during meals.\nBig City, No Small Matters Big City, No Small Matters is a police documentary produced by Oriental Satellite TV. Unlike Guarding Liberation West, this program shifts its focus from grassroots police station affairs to the actions against crime, concentrating on criminal and economic cases in Shanghai (referred to as \u0026lsquo;Shen City\u0026rsquo;). The show embeds itself within various criminal investigation and economic investigation teams across Shanghai, closely following the processes of solving cases involving forensic science, anti-theft, anti-fraud, plainclothes operations, major cases, and drug enforcement. Viewers can experience the intensity firsthand through the lens, accompanying law enforcement officers to the front lines of capturing suspects, immersively feeling the tense atmosphere and recreating the thrilling moments of apprehension.\nCriminal and economic crimes are more serious and hardcore compared to civil cases. This series covers not only recurring heinous acts such as drug trafficking and tax evasion but also new forms of crime like online and telecommunications fraud. The show particularly highlights these novel criminal methods, serving as a stark reminder that \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rsquo;s net is vast and though it may have gaps, none can escape.\u0026rdquo; It further embodies the professional attitude of investigative teams who constantly monitor and vigilantly protect society. A thought-provoking aspect is that a significant number of suspects involved in online fraud are young people adept at internet technology, yet often lack knowledge about relevant laws, only realizing they\u0026rsquo;ve broken the law upon arrest. This underscores the importance of economic legal education. Concurrently, elderly individuals are more susceptible to falling victim to online scams, making it an urgent social development issue to integrate this demographic into an increasingly digital payment-dominated environment.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re drawn to the hardcore elements of criminal and economic investigations, eager to explore the strategies behind cracking major cases, or simply wish to experience the adrenaline rush of frontline law enforcement, Big City, No Small Matters might just be the perfect fit for you.\nForensic Files Forensic Files is a police documentary produced by China Central Television, which uses a series of classic cases as a vehicle to narrate the entire process of case investigation from the perspective of forensic experts, tightly integrating criminalistics with detective work. Although the program mainly tells the story through the eyes of forensic experts, it presents a comprehensive view of all stages from identification to apprehension, featuring a tight pace and interlocking clues and motives, creating a strong sense of deduction that is both suspenseful and captivating.\nThe show particularly highlights the forensic criminal investigation techniques, which are highly specialized and core content.

Setting Disclaimer: This is a derivative creation, all copyrights belong to miHoYo.\nAll plot elements are purely fictional and unrelated to any historical figures or nations.\nIntroduction In a time of extreme instability across the globe, the General suddenly issued a Sword Hunt Decree, ordering the confiscation of swords carried by civilians, which incited discontent among various samurai factions and civilian organizations, leading them to unite and form a resistance army. Despite being intended to stabilize society, this decision only exacerbated social unrest. Amidst the chaos, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend bravely ventured forth alone to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at the Imperial Court, witnessing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen figure. Forced to flee with his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, Wanye inherited his friend\u0026rsquo;s legacy and was rescued by pirates during his pursuit, ultimately fostering collaboration between the pirates and the resistance army. Raising the banner of rebellion, Wanye finally stood before the General, using his sense of righteousness to illustrate the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nCharacter Settings Wanye: A wandering samurai hailing from a once-proud but now destitute samurai family. Courteous in demeanor, gentle yet romantic, he enjoys composing poetry and displays the carefree spirit of a rōnin while nurturing a deep compassion for the suffering of all living beings. He remains calm and contented, cherishing nature and possessing acute hearing and exceptional martial prowess, especially fond of maple leaves. His voice quality is youthful, primarily resonating in the larynx with a hint of chest resonance; his pronunciation originates near the hard palate. Friend: A wandering samurai characterized by his open and bold personality, determined and valiant, with a heart set on sacrificing himself to save others. Skilled in martial arts, he believes himself to be the one capable of standing before the General to remonstrate, choosing to do so single-handedly, ultimately falling in combat within the Imperial Court but leaving a lasting impact through his courage and sense of righteousness. The General: The ruler, revered by the populace as a War God, having undergone significant personal changes following multiple wars where her loved ones perished, gradually becoming detached from the people. She pursued the concept of \u0026ldquo;eternal immutability\u0026rdquo; and enacted the Sword Hunt Decree to maintain national stability. Eventually, she comes to realize the decree\u0026rsquo;s irrationality under the influence of Wanye and his friend. Big Sister: The leader of the pirate gang, known for her bold and straightforward demeanor. She particularly appreciates Wanye\u0026rsquo;s poetic talents. Strategist: The leader of the resistance army advocating for the right of civilians to carry swords, believing that the collective power of the people could sway the General\u0026rsquo;s stance. [Voice acting guidance for each character should refer to the original game soundtrack.]\nOutline Act 1: The Encounter of Wanye and His Friend Act 2: Conversation Aboard the Ship Act 3: The Early Stages of the Sword Hunt Decree - The Friend\u0026rsquo;s Remonstration and Departure Act 4: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Fugitive Experience Act 5: Pirates and the Resistance Army Act 6: Wanye\u0026rsquo;s Advice Finale: Wanye Honors His Friend Synopsis During a period of intense global instability, the General unexpectedly instigated a Sword Hunt Decree, aiming to collect privately-owned swords, causing dissatisfaction among various samurais and civilian groups, who consequently coalesced into a resistance force. The policy, initially designed to stabilize the nation, instead triggered massive societal upheaval. In the tumultuous times, Wanye\u0026rsquo;s friend ventured solo to remonstrate, but Wanye arrived too late at court, seeing only his friend\u0026rsquo;s fallen silhouette. Taking his friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and fleeing, Wanye, inheriting his friend\u0026rsquo;s aspirations, united with pirates during his escape, leading to cooperation between pirates and the resistance army. Ultimately, he faced the General with a compassionate heart, demonstrating the unreasonableness of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPlay Act I: The Sleeve Fluttering in Autumn Wind Asking for Red Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Acquaintance\nSetting: A forest clearing in the wilderness\n[Environmental Sounds] {Wan Ye kneels down to play a leaf whistle, finishing with reciting poetry}\nWan Ye: Traversing the deep mountains amidst red leaves, my ears ask after deer’s song. [Brief rustling wind sound]\n{Wan Ye sits up, flutters his sleeves, accompanied by the sound of fabric swaying and unsheathing a blade}\nWan Ye: Who approaches?\n{The Acquaintance enters from behind Wan Ye}\nAcquaintance: No need to be so tense, little brother. (pauses for 1 second) Your clothes may seem tattered at first glance, but the design is incredibly intricate. If I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken, the maple leaf pattern on your attire is your family crest, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nWan Ye: So what if it is? Are you here to rob me, or to duel?\nAcquaintance: Haha, maybe just to compare swords. {Both draw their blades and charge towards each other}\n[Sounds of footsteps][Clashing of blades]\nWan Ye and Acquaintance: (grunting and exerting effort during the sword exchange)\nWan Ye: Huh {Wan Ye parries the blade}[Their swords lock momentarily]\nAcquaintance: Good swordsmanship! (laughs) How did you manage to spot me just now?\nWan Ye: I can hear the wind\u0026rsquo;s voice, and it grew unusually restless just now, suggesting you\u0026rsquo;re someone who can\u0026rsquo;t keep still. Yet, I also detect no malice in you.\nAcquaintance: Haha, even though you sensed no ill intent, your strike was quite fierce.\nWan Ye: When comparing swords, one naturally gives it their all; otherwise, how could we justify the stirring of the wind. But I believe that chance encounters have their own significance. My name is Wan Ye, and yours?\n{Sound fades out as the memory ends}\n[End of Flashback]\nAct II: The Oceanic Gale That Hurts Maple Leaves Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Acquaintance\nSetting: Onboard a ship\n[Gradually intensifying sea breeze] {Wan Ye wakes up from a dream, feeling a bit of a headache}\n(Allow breathing sounds for 2 seconds)\nWan Ye: Ah (sighs)\n{Sister Leader walks up to engage in conversation, footsteps on wooden deck}\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, we\u0026rsquo;re about to set sail soon. What are you daydreaming about here?\nWan Ye: Just reminiscing about some past events.\nSister Leader: Speaking of past events, I really did bring this unknown and potentially dangerous element onto the ship.\nWan Ye: (chuckles lightly) Sister Leader, you jest. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t time before to explain. (pauses for 1 second) My past\u0026hellip; the most memorable part was when I lived as a wandering samurai, drifting without roots, no fixed abode, yet there were benefits. Staying too long in one place would create a distance between me and nature. Perhaps wandering is indeed the lifestyle most suited for me.\nSister Leader: Wandering and drifting, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like our life on this ship, sailing with the waves, never anchoring for long at any port.\nWan Ye: But my life might be more akin to a maple leaf dancing in the wind, unattached to anything, free from burdens and attachments, acquainting myself with all things under heaven and earth, inhaling the essence of the four directions—this is the state I enjoy.\nSister Leader: Why the maple leaf?\nWan Ye: I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an affinity for maple leaves, though they often symbolize partings during their crimson season.\nSister Leader: But the red leaves are like fire, passionate and radiant.\nWan Ye: Yes, indeed they are.\nSister Leader: I have another question—how did a wanderer like you end up being wanted by your lord?\nWan Ye: {Wan Ye lifts his sword} That story begins with the owner of this very sword.\nAct III: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Passerby\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: He used to be my closest friend. That day he asked me about\u0026hellip; {soliloquy fades out}\n[Natural sounds, bird calls, etc.] {Wan Ye practices swordplay with his friend, both panting slightly afterwards}\nFriend: Wan Ye, have you ever heard of the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;?[Cat meows] {Wan Ye pets the cat}\nWan Ye: Of course, such a blade is only seen during divine retribution. It represents the pinnacle of the general\u0026rsquo;s martial arts prowess, symbolizing ultimate strength.\nFriend: However, that blade may not be entirely unattainable. There are living beings on earth who dare to face the might of thunderbolts.\nWan Ye: Nonetheless, currently, my swordsmanship cannot compare to that of the general.\nFriend: Haha, aiming for it is still a worthy goal nonetheless.\nWan Ye: (light chuckle) Mm.\nFriend: I will dedicate my life to pursuing the utmost limit of martial arts, to confront that \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo;.\nWan Ye: But I\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered, why do we travel far and wide, honing our swordsmanship? What does a samurai\u0026rsquo;s sword truly mean? Before my wandering days, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the meaning of swordsmanship within the remnants of my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings.\nFriend: Wan Ye, if someday our land is eroded by calamity, and its people are no longer under the watchful eye of the gods, what choice would you make?\nWan Ye: I suppose I\u0026rsquo;d choose to live a life of anonymity.\nFriend: Humph, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. {pats Wan Ye\u0026rsquo;s shoulder}\nWan Ye: Huh? [Cat meows]\n{Friend departs}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: Later, unexpectedly, the Sword Hunt Decree came into effect, and the people\u0026rsquo;s wishes gradually became bricks and mortar for constructing \u0026ldquo;eternity\u0026rdquo;. {soliloquy fades out}\n[Light rain] {Wan Ye walks down the street}\nPasserby A: (whispering) Have you heard about the Sword Hunt Decree\u0026hellip;\nPasserby B: Yeah, these days soldiers patrol the streets frequently, and occasionally you can hear the distant sound of swords clashing.\nPasserby A: It\u0026rsquo;s said that some samurais have formed a resistance army, demanding the repeal of the Sword Hunt Decree.\nPasserby B: Actually, issuing the Sword Hunt Decree at this time\u0026hellip; {voice trails off}\nSamurai A: (whispering) What should we do in this situation?\nSamurai B: Maybe we should just surrender our swords obediently.\nSamurai A: (barely containing anger) How could we? The sword is\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Fleeing reluctantly, amidst flashing blades and tumultuous journeys, the land now sees samurai\u0026rsquo;s aspirations ruthlessly stripped away. Enduring warfare perplexes me, whether it\u0026rsquo;s due to samurai\u0026rsquo;s obstinacy or sudden policy shifts.\n{While Wan Ye contemplates, Passersby C and D discuss the Friend}\nPasserby C: There are unusually few patrolling soldiers today.\nPasserby D: Word has it that a wandering samurai challenged the general in a royal court duel today, which is why most soldiers are maintaining order. {Wan Ye stops, exhales heavily}\nPasserby C: This samurai is indeed brave. Challenging the general in a royal court duel is the sole means to demand change from those pursuing eternity, but failure means certain death.\nPasserby D: To defy the dignity of the \u0026lsquo;God of War\u0026rsquo; takes real courage.\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s inner thoughts: Could it be him\u0026hellip;\n{Wan Ye turns and sprints towards the royal palace} [Rain and footsteps fade out]\n[Rain and thunder sounds]\n{Wan Ye runs up the steps, panting}\n[At the moment Wan Ye reaches the royal court, lightning strikes, and the Friend falls]\nWan Ye: (inhales sharply in shock)\n{Wan Ye rushes forward to embrace the fallen Friend} [Hugging sound followed by the sound of the sword falling]\nWan Ye: (clenching teeth) {Wan Ye picks up his Friend\u0026rsquo;s sword and escapes, ending with the sound of getting up}\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy: The royal court duel is solemn and brutal; the loser faces divine punishment while the winner earns a turning point. Perhaps he thought himself the best candidate to stand up. Confronting the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; was his lifelong pursuit. When I arrived, the duel had ended, and all I heard was the sound of his sword hitting the ground after \u0026lsquo;divine retribution\u0026rsquo;. That must have been the radiance he sought to witness. In his final moments, what expression graced his face? There was no time to ponder; I seized his sword and fled. All I knew was that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t let his fervent wish be cast into a cold statue. {soliloquy ends}\nAfter the Third Act: Reminiscence Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader\nSetting: Onboard the ship\nSister Leader: Your friend is truly admirable. Despite having different beliefs and ideals, you two conversed harmoniously, making it indeed a fateful encounter as you mentioned.\nWan Ye: Although I\u0026rsquo;ve never fully understood what samurais stubbornly pursue, upon picking up my friend\u0026rsquo;s sword, I finally comprehended his aspirations and convictions, and realized the significance of starting a journey with the sword for a samurai.\nSister Leader: You think this conviction must be witnessed by the general herself, hence why you convinced me to accept the resistance army\u0026rsquo;s employment.\nWan Ye: Sister Leader, you\u0026rsquo;re perceptive indeed. Even though you know of my personal motive, you won\u0026rsquo;t refuse this employment anymore.\nSister Leader: Such a fiery desire – I\u0026rsquo;m also curious whether it can shake the \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; upheld by the general.\nWan Ye: Many times, I questioned myself if my discontent with the general stemmed from that royal court duel or her decisive strike against my friend. But I realize it\u0026rsquo;s not that; I simply want righteousness to be met with righteousness. Is the \u0026lsquo;Thoughtless Blade\u0026rsquo; truly unattainable? Perhaps one day, we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to confront that kind of overwhelming power, which is precisely why I want to return.\nConclusion of the Previous Episode Characters: The General\nSetting: Silent Royal Palace\nGeneral: Amidst this fleeting world, not only dreams can manifest in slumber; everything is ephemeral. The world is like a dream, and only \u0026rsquo;eternity\u0026rsquo; can protect all sentient beings. Desires are perhaps the most unstable factor. But, much like then, he charged forth fearlessly, much like you, sister.\nPrevious Episode Ends\nNext Episode Opening Characters: The General, Attendant\nSetting: Silent Imperial Residence\nGeneral: What is the current battle situation?\nAttendant: We\u0026rsquo;re still at a standoff; there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been an opportunity to wipe out the Resistance Army in one fell swoop.\nGeneral: (pondering) Hmm. Ordinarily isolated samurais have managed to form an alliance, despite differing philosophies. How have these diverse individuals come together and achieved a unity that rivals the military\u0026rsquo;s might? Such power cannot be ignored.\nAttendant: What orders do you have, General?\nGeneral: I will set out tomorrow to quell the Resistance Army. You may withdraw for now.\nAttendant: Understood. {Attendant retreats}\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Soliloquy: Changes brought about by samurais are not something \u0026lsquo;Eternity\u0026rsquo; tolerates, but this particular change does not instill unease in me.\nAct IV Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Pursuers\n[Sea Breeze][Flapping of sails][Surf Sound]\nWan Ye: The sound of the waves and the rustling of fine leaves in bamboo groves bear a striking resemblance.\nSister Leader: Ha, Wan Ye, I took the risk of sheltering you aboard this fleet not to listen to poetic musings.\nWan Ye: I know, but this moonlight before the great battle is something neither of us should waste. (sighs softly) It would be perfect with a flask of sake.\nSister Leader: You mean, the great battle?\nWan Ye: Yes. This scent in the wind, much like that night, signifies warning.\n{Flashback scene}\n{Wan Ye running}\nPursuer: Stop!\n{Wan Ye halts}\nWan Ye: (resigned sigh), Just one step away from the rendezvous port, and yet you still found me.\nPursuer: By the Sword Hunt Decree, hand over your swords.\nWan Ye: If you could make an exception for me, it might go smoother.\n{Wan Ye pivots}{Pause for 1s}\nPursuer: (astonished) Maple leaf?\n{Wan Ye draws his sword}\nPursuer: (cries out) Ahh! {Two voices here to indicate multiple pursuers}\n{End of flashback}\nWan Ye: Let\u0026rsquo;s lower the sails, Sister Leader; it\u0026rsquo;s time to brace for the storm.\n[Sound of a large ship moving]\nAct V Characters: Wan Ye, Sister Leader, Strategist, Rogue\n[Thunderclap][Ship anchors]\nSister Leader: Wan Ye, since you initiated this, you handle the liaison with the Resistance Army.\nWan Ye: Alright. Sister Leader, take a stroll around the harbor and wait for my message.\n{Wan Ye departs}\n{Sister Leader wanders around}\nSister Leader: Huh? There\u0026rsquo;s actually a poem written on this bulletin board: \u0026ldquo;This body is like autumn leaves adrift across mountains and seas.\u0026rdquo; Ha!\n{Sister Leader writes on the bulletin board}\nSister Leader: We\u0026rsquo;re back! Kid, write another poem!\nPasserby: Hey, this is a bulletin board, not a message board.\nSister Leader: Hahaha. [Voice fades out]\n{Wan Ye sits by the riverbank waiting for the Strategist}\nWan Ye: Clouds disperse above high skies, revealing the reflection of home in the sunset glow. Mm, [flourish of his sleeve] the last line.\n{An arrow whizzes by; Wan Ye dodges, arrow lands in water}\nWan Ye: Honestly, I already lack poetic talent, and then to be interrupted like this.\n{Wan Ye advances, his sword moves like a shadow, swiftly resolving the situation}\nWan Ye: Oh, I got it now. The last line is, \u0026ldquo;A wanderer\u0026rsquo;s heart drifts.\u0026rdquo;\n{Strategist applauds}\nStrategist: Wan Ye, you remain as sharp as ever. No wonder you escaped from the general\u0026rsquo;s grasp; looks like our Resistance Army will gain a formidable warrior.\nWan Ye: Strategist, you know why I\u0026rsquo;ve come. Our Resistance Army gains more than just a warrior.\nStrategist: What are your conditions?\nWan Ye: Sister Leader\u0026rsquo;s goal is simple: money and entertainment. As for me, I merely hope to advise the general, to share our way of the samurai.\nStrategist: That royal court duel\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I hold no grudge against the general. The winner gains an opportunity, the loser faces divine punishment – that\u0026rsquo;s the rule. But our voices should be heard by the general.\nStrategist: Our views align unexpectedly; we do not intend to provoke civil war. In the face of foreign threats, unity is paramount. However, the general\u0026rsquo;s decisions have left many samurais disillusioned. We assembled into an army not to rebel, but to impose order and reduce chaos. Since the general no longer accepts royal court duels, we can only\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: I understand what Strategist intends. You hope to break through the heavily guarded imperial residence to directly advise the general.\nStrategist: Exactly. Currently, our samurai forces are evenly matched with the military. We need an unforeseen force to influence the battle. Moreover, according to reliable intelligence, the general will personally lead the troops soon, and we can use this opportunity to show our resolve to her.\nWan Ye: Resolve\u0026hellip; I doubt the general would merely listen based on that alone. For us samurai, what is the original intention behind wielding our swords\u0026hellip; {voice fades out}\nAct VI Characters: Wan Ye, The General, Sister Leader, Strategist, Samurai, Soldiers\nScene: Battlefield\n[Rendered battlefield][Thunderstorm sounds]\n(Samurai forces are retreating)\nSoldier A: The General is indeed extraordinary; upon her arrival on the battlefield, she commands like a deity, driving the Resistance Army into continuous retreat.\nSoldier B: Indeed, with her here, it seems this turmoil is finally coming to an end!\nGeneral: Advance! Give the Resistance the final blow.\n(Soldiers charge)\nStrategist: Finally, my hidden soldiers.\n(Pirates join the fray)\nWan Ye: You\u0026rsquo;re quite patient, Strategist.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader charge)\nSister Leader: I hope you can afford the price of hiring us, rebels.\n(Wan Ye and Sister Leader are about to confront the General)\nSoldier A: Not good, hurry and protect the General!\nSoldier B: We can\u0026rsquo;t extricate ourselves right now!\nSister Leader: General, let me behold your supreme martial skills.\nGeneral: Hmph, those who attempt to shatter eternity, show me your resolve.\n(The General unsheathes her sword and slashes forward)\n(Sister Leader retreats)\n(The General strikes again) [Thunderclap]\n(Flashback) Friend: There are always earthly creatures bold enough to face the might of thunderbolts.\n(Wan Ye steps forward)\nWan Ye: Sister Leader!\n(Wan Ye blocks the General\u0026rsquo;s strike)\nWan Ye: (with effort)\nWan Ye\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: What expression would he have in that final moment?\nWan Ye: (gathers strength)\n(Wan Ye pushes the General\u0026rsquo;s sword away)\nGeneral: (startled inhale)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: That same expression once more.\n(The General slashes again, pushing Wan Ye back)\n(Wan Ye struggles to rise)\nWan Ye: (groans in pain)\n(Soldiers surround them)\nSoldier: General!\nGeneral: Stand aside for now.\n(Soldiers retreat, the General approaches Wan Ye)\nGeneral: I remember you. The day a samurai challenged me in a royal court duel, I exacted punishment, and you, stole his sword. I marked you as a top priority target, yet you managed to elude capture.\nWan Ye: Never meant to offend the General; there were extenuating circumstances.\nGeneral: Your friend has fallen beneath my blade. And you, having witnessed the outcome of defiance firsthand, why persist on this path?\nWan Ye: General, it\u0026rsquo;s not just me who\u0026rsquo;s resolute. Most likely, we merely wish to safeguard our swords, our desires.\nGeneral: Desires? Has the ancient samurai spirit not been lost, leaving only empty shells of swordsmanship techniques? In this chaotic era, isn\u0026rsquo;t a samurai wielding a sword only adding to the confusion? As a samurai from a noble house yourself, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you understand whether the true essence of the samurai code still exists within your family\u0026rsquo;s teachings, let alone wandering samurais who might not comprehend the ethics they should adhere to?\nWan Ye: The General has a point; the samurai code is barely discernible in my family\u0026rsquo;s teachings anymore. Through my travels and sparring with various samurais, I too have failed to find it.\nGeneral: Given this\u0026hellip;\nWan Ye: Yet my dear friend, even in his vulnerability, sought opportunities for samurais. Despite the hardships, he chose to appeal alone. And the samurais, though begrudgingly, avoid unnecessary conflict and unite despite their differences.\nGeneral: So this is your perspective. What do you think samurai aspire to achieve with their swords?\nWan Ye: I believe it\u0026rsquo;s the unwavering commitment to and propagation of the samurai ethos. Each samurai household possesses its unique traditions, hence the vast and complex samurai community. Every martial art needs its own lineage, and among them, swordsmanship is something that must never be forsaken, which is why the samurai react against the Sword Hunt Decree.\nGeneral: Even so, the scattered factions of samurai, each adhering to their distinct ways of swordsmanship, present an inherently unstable element, conflicting with the eternal peace I strive for.\nWan Ye: However, if utilized properly, the power of the samurai can also serve to protect eternity. Earlier, my friend asked me,\nWan Ye \u0026amp; Friend: If one day our land is ravaged by disaster, and the people are no longer under the protection of the gods,\nFriend: What would you choose to do?\nWan Ye: When our land is beset by disaster, a samurai would unhesitatingly uphold the moral principles they cherish. Upholding benevolence, righteousness, propriety, sincerity, honor, loyalty, and bravery - samurai pursue benevolence, thus even in defiance, they ensure not to harm the innocent populace; they pursue righteousness and propriety, therefore even in rebellion, they establish alliances openly and honorably; they strive for loyalty and bravery, thus never harboring intentions to usurp power. Samurais do not disdain the world, nor do they incite chaos; they wield not weapons of slaughter, but swords that breathe life into the samurai spirit, ultimately guarding the samurai way. The samurai spirit is not lost; rather, it lies dormant in the peaceful passage of generations, ready to awaken as an unparalleled force when called upon.\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: In this conflict, am I the only one escalating it?\nWan Ye: General, why do you pursue eternity?\nGeneral: (deep breath) My sister once promised eternity to her subjects, where time flows but nothing changes. Yet, she who promised eternity could not sustain it herself, sacrificing her life in the previous anti-invasion war, exchanging it for the peace that prevails until today. Taking her place as the ruler, I inherit her promise; as the highest and most revered figure, I must offer my people a dream, named Eternity. (pause) Do you feel the bitter pain every time you grasp your sword? Though the power of swords and blades can crush countless enemies and overcome numerous challenges, there are things that cannot be cleaved by swords, even she, who protected her people with her sword, was but a fleeting dream, vanishing suddenly.\nWan Ye: There is no escaping pain. Dreams may be ephemeral, but they possess the brightest colors. Humans are not immortal, yet they possess boundless potential. Disasters lurk everywhere, sacrifices occur at any moment, but those who sacrifice themselves illuminate the entire sky with their burning passion, while those who continue to carry dreams will keep forging ahead, protecting our land.\nGeneral: Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re right; the conflict should not continue. (sighs) Policy changes require careful consideration. For now, maintain the unity of the samurai league. (loudly) Withdraw the troops!\n(The General departs)\nGeneral\u0026rsquo;s Thoughts: Although her physical existence may vanish like a dream, she has transformed into the divine cherry blossom in our hearts, and perhaps that is also a form of eternity.
